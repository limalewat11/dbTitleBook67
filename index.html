The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. The He bade them, &#39;Follow Me.&#39;&#34; . . . &#34;Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without fruit&#34; (The Ministry of Healing, pp. 143, 144). Using the above quote as the basis for his book, Dr. Philip Samaan focuses on six progressive steps Christ used in witnessing. He shows how we can, through an intimate relationship with Him, follow this pattern to bring God&#39;s love, compassion, and transformation to those around us. As you read, you&#39;ll discover listening skills that will enable you to express sympathy and detect people&#39;s felt and real needs. You&#39;ll learn how to develop meaningful, unconditional friendships that create trust and a yearning to associated with Jesus. And you&#39;ll gain helpful ideas on how to share you personal testimony, use intercessory prayer, and impart biblical truth. Christ&#39;s Method will help free you of any anxiety you might have about witnessing, and enable you to find the joy, spontaneity, and success that come only from having a vibrant relationship with Jesus and genuinely loving people. Living out this Method in your spheres of influence will help you impact your family, church, and community for Christ. This book is an updated and expanded version of Christ&#39;s Way of Reaching People.</p><p></p><h2>American Sea Writing: A Literary Anthology (Library of America)</h2><p>An anthology of American maritime writing captures the beauty, danger, and mythology of America&#39;s seagoing experience, from the legend of the Flying Dutchman to John McPhee&#39;s writings on the vulnerability of ships in the modern era.</p><p>Drawing on literary masterworks and riveting firsthand narratives, travel writing and natural science, memoir and journalism, AMERICAN SEA WRITING captures the full sweep of America&#x2019;s maritime experience.

The novel&#39;s portrait of life in the precariously settled coastal town of Desperance centres on the powerful Phantom family, leader of the Westend Pricklebush people, and its battles with old Joseph Midnight&#39;s renegade Eastend mob on the one hand, and the white officials of Uptown and the neighbouring Gurfurrit mine on the other. Wright&#39;s storytelling is operatic and surreal: a blend of myth and scripture, politics and farce. The novel teems with extraordinary characters - the outcast saviour Elias Smith, the religious zealot Mozzie Fishman, the murderous mayor Bruiser, the moth-ridden Captain Nicoli Finn, the activist Will Phantom, and above all, the rulers of the family, the queen of the rubbish-dump and the fish-embalming king of time, Angel Day and Normal Phantom - figures of such an intense imagining, they stand like giants in this storm-swept world....</p><p></p><h2>Spelling 4 Te Bk and CD 2nd Ed</h2><p>The completely revised Spelling 4 Teacher&#39;s Edition (2nd ed.) is a critical piece of the Spelling 4 curriculum, coordinating all instruction and activities.

The program has been carefully designed to use instructional aids and strategies to meet the diversity of student learning styles. We believe that one way to meet student diversity is through inquiry-based learning. Physics A First Course is created around the premise that science is a process of exploration and discovery of ideas and that this new knowledge connects and enhances lives. Each of our eight chapters starts and ends with an investigation, bringing discovery to the students before and after reading the Student Edition. To support multiple-learning needs, the Student edition is reinforced with graphics that tell the same story in visual aids as the text. This provides students who prefer to learn through graphic representation another learning option. A Connection selection is included at the end of each chapter. These short, motivating articles demonstrate how science works in everyday life. Accompanying support and enrichment materials are available to round out the teaching process.</p><p></p><h2>Homefront</h2><p><p><em>The daughter of ex-cop Phil Broker andex-army major/anti-terrorist operative Nina Pryce, Kit Brokeris no ordinary eight-year-old. She has seen more -- and survived more -- than most grown-ups. And now she has inadvertently invited a nightmare into the lives of those she loves.</em></p><p>Phil Broker and his family moved to tiny Glacier Falls, Minnesota, to heal from the psychological wounds they received while helping to avert an inhuman act of terror. But young Kit chose the wrong adversary when she triumphed over local schoolyard bully Teddy Klumpe -- for the boy's disreputable clan does unholy business from the darkest shadows of their small town . . . and they do not forgive. What begins as a minor feud between neighbors quickly escalates into a major offensive of intimidation, destruction, fear . . . and death. And the worst is yet to come -- because terror has come home. </p></p><p>Nina Pryce, one of a select few women attached to the Army's elite Delta Force, is on an extended medical leave, recovering from a firefight with a terrorist that claimed the lives of two teammates and left her badly injured. While her body has begun to heal, her psychic wounds are still raw; unable to care for her daughter, repair the damage to her marriage, or face the fact that her military career is over, she and her family take refuge in a remote Minnesota town. But trouble seems to follow in her wake, and what begins as a schoolyard fight between her daughter and a bullying classmate soon escalates into a terrifying standoff with a clan of backwoods methamphetamine "cookers" and a hitman bent on revenge against Nina's husband Phil Broker, a former undercover cop. Logan expertly balances the tough and the tender, as Broker attempts to nurse his wife back to health, protect eight-year-old Kit from the effects of her mother's post-traumatic depression, and guard those he loves from the legacy of his own violent past. Logan's solid pacing, strong narrative drive, and expert rendering of two complex characters whose unusual relationship is as fascinting as they are make this sixth title in an excellent series a standout guaranteed to keep the reader's attention riveted until the last page. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Chuck Logan is the author of eight novels, including <em>After the Rain</em>, <em>Vapor Trail</em>, <em>Absolute Zero</em>, and <em>The Big Law</em>.

Love inclines us to get married, but we need grace to keep that love healthy, strong and committed. More than simply "nice," grace is that game-changing ingredient that enables us to treat each other the way God treats us&#x2014;even when we don't deserve it.</p> <p>In <em>Grace Filled Marriage</em> Kimmel explores questions such as:</p> <ul> <li>How can you show grace when all your spouse seems to do right now is frustrate you?</li> <li>How can grace ramp up the frequency and temperature of your sex life?</li> <li>How do you show grave without being taken advantage of?</li> <li>How can God help you make grace the default mode in your marriage?</li> </ul> <p>Whether your marriage is just beginning, seems healthy, or is struggling on life support, a deeper understanding of the power of grace will help it not just survive, but thrive.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Amazing Grace is normally sung in church.

This book is a treasure. You have reminded us and called us back to the vision of marriage reflecting God's character, especially his unconditional love and grace. Regrettably, guilt-ridden performance has replaced this lofty vision. Although it is good to know and apply helpful relational skills in marriage, if they are not baptized in God's grace they become pathways to frustration. Grace Filled Marriage shows us how to create a grace-filled environment in which marriage will flourish. This is one of the most important, helpful books on marriage I have read in a decade.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;DR. CRAWFORD W.

We have read them all - every marriage book known to mankind - but this one is really different! Without re-hashing traditional marriage passages, Tim helps us rediscover that "Grace" is the key to long-term relationships. And since Grace is the only attribute of God that Satan simply cannot imitate, what better place to get our arms around this incredible gift!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;ED AND GWEN DIAZ , 71:17 Ministries <br><br>&#x201c;Very few people understand the practical implications of grace, quite like Tim Kimmel. Many speak about grace; Tim helps us all understand how to apply grace to that relationship in our life that demands it the most. Grace Filled Marriage is a must for every couple's library ... a great read that might just change your life ... it might just change your family, and it will truly change your marriage.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;MARK GREGSTONThere are few places on the planet where grace is less often expressed than in marriage. We often show more grace to our competitors in sports, politics, and business than we do to our husbands or wives. Think about it . . .<br> � What does grace have to do with marriage? Vital elements like forgiveness,<br> security, significance, acceptance, approval, intimacy&#x2015;all are words of<br> grace for which we hunger.<br> � What does a grace-filled marriage look like? We hear grace in our tone<br> of voice. We see grace in expressions on our faces. We feel grace in the<br> warmth of a touch. We taste grace in acts of simple courtesy. We smell<br> grace in the fragrance of shared prayers and desires.<br> Dr. Kimmel shows you how to evaluate your own grace-aptitude, and then leads you step-by-step into grace intelligence that will transform first you, and then your marriage.</p><h2>Cahier d&#39;un Retour au Pays Natal (French Edition)</h2><p>Aime Cesaire, black poet, play, and political activist, was born in 1913 in Martinique in the French Caribbean.

The contributors to Bearing Witness are women who have made a lifestyle out of rising from their warm beds in the middle of the night to answer pages from their clients, of leaving their home and families sometimes for days on end. We do this because most doulas want to help change our birth customs. We want to educate women and advocate for natural childbirth so that they achieve a positive birth experience and feel strong and confident in themselves and will mother their babies in a healthy way. Birth needs to become human again. It needs to reclaim its wild primacy. Peace on earth does indeed begin with birth.</p><p>Dr. Lisa Doran is a naturopathic doctor and a doula who has worked in the field of fertility, pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care since 1992. She believes that conscious conception and natural birth advocacy are an important part of maternal and child health promotion and disease prevention. Dr. Doran teaches maternal/newborn care at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. Lisa Caron&#39;s passion to foster healthy, confident families led her to train as a birth doula, postpartum doula, and a childbirth educator. She found her calling to birth work while volunteering with pregnant teens in 1996 and has since attended more than 250 births in homes and hospitals.Introduction &#34;We have a secret in our culture, it&#39;s not that birth is painful, it&#39;s that women are strong.&#34; Laurie Stavoe Harm &#34;Birth is not only about making babies. Birth is about making mothers - strong, competent, capable mothers who trust themselves and know their inner strength.&#34; Barbara Katz Rothman There is wisdom in these pages. I am humbled by the volumes of experience shared, the voices we hear, the stories told. These stories are wonderfully real, they are emotional, they reflect how we so often have the opportunity to experience the joy of something divine, a woman giving birth. But birth can be difficult and some of these stories are be raw. The authors may carry frustration with them surrounding their experience as witness to modern birth practises applied to a deeply intimate event. These stories are presented here to you from the heart, with courage and very truthfully by the women who support women giving birth powerfully. The contributors to Bearing Witness are all women who have made a lifestyle out of rising from their warm beds in the middle of the night to answer pages from their clients, of leaving their home and families sometimes for days on end. We do this because most doulas wish to help to bring the change in birth that we see needs to come. Birth needs to become human again. It needs to reclaim its wild primacy. So many women are set free when they are allowed to birth as they need to. We want to educate and support mothers so that they understand their choices and so that they achieve a positive birth experience based on their own informed choices. Being an effective doula and advocating for natural birth contributes to moms who feel strong and confident in themselves and will mother their babies in a healthy way. Peace on earth does indeed begin with birth. Most of these women are not writers and I salute their courage at baring all, taking a risk when putting pen to paper, and sharing a part of their lives with us so effectively. Some of these women are brilliant authors and story tellers and I thank them all from my heart for your eloquence and vision. Some of these stories come to you as poems, as imagery, as interviews or from recordings taken at story circles. What this collective project has become is a vehicle for women to express what it has been like for them to be a part of a very unique community.

I&#x2019;d stupidly worn flip-flops to take the dog out one last time before bed, and my feet were half numb as I stumbled along the path at the edge of the woods. Gravy had been lured out for a walk fairly easily with a heel of bread but predictably turned sluggish when I tried to maneuver him up the sloping field back toward the house. I couldn&#x2019;t blame him; my place didn&#x2019;t feel like home to him yet, the wood floors too slippery, the stairs too steep for his stubby legs, the furniture not yet sufficiently covered with his fur. I wiggled the leash, begging him to hurry up and pee, knowing full well how futile it was, that the elderly dog would wet himself in his sleep no matter how many times I took him out. The wind receded without warning, pulling me off balance, and in the merciful lull the night was eerily silent, as though all the creatures in the blind depths of the cedars were holding still, waiting out the storm.<br><br>My phone buzzed and I nearly dropped it, my frozen fingers skittering across the glowing screen. When I saw that it was Becca, I didn&#x2019;t want to answer, because my sister only called this late if she&#x2019;d seen something awful on the ten o&#x2019;clock news or if someone we knew had died. Less than a month ago, she&#x2019;d called about Shane.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have the news on?&#x201d; she asked. She was whispering, as she always did when Jerry and the boys were asleep, and I could barely hear her.<br><br>&#x201c;No, what happened?&#x201d; I stamped my feet, trying to revive feeling in them. Gravy&#x2019;s pace had slowed from maddeningly snail-like to standstill. He watched the tree line, his tail low, a pale specter in the darkness.<br><br>&#x201c;Hunters found a human skull in the woods outside Blackwater. They&#x2019;re not saying too much, but the lady said it was small . . . like a child&#x2019;s. Maybe Macey Calhoun&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>My gut hollowed out and I bent over, feeling like I might vomit. Macey&#x2019;s absence had mostly faded from my thoughts, the way other people&#x2019;s tragedies tend to do in the face of our own problems. I had brought a chocolate pie over to Hannah Calhoun after her husband had disappeared with their daughter, not knowing how else to help an old friend I&#x2019;d barely spoken to in years. It had gone as uncomfortably as I expected it would, Hannah accepting my offering and shutting the door without saying a word, consumed by her loss and uninterested in my sympathy.<br><br>Macey and Lily had attended preschool together in the basement of Shade Tree Methodist from the time they were babies until Lily left for kindergarten. Hannah and I had been close then, bound by our daughters and the common struggles of new marriage and motherhood. Hannah had recognized my ineptitude in styling Lily&#x2019;s hair and took pity, teaching me to French-braid and making enormous bows for Lil to match the ones Macey wore every day. Macey would be nine now, almost ten, more than a year behind Lil, who only vaguely remembered their preschool friendship when the Amber Alert shrieked out of my phone this past spring and I told her that Macey was missing.<br><br>The bitterness of the Calhouns&#x2019; divorce and ensuing custody battle was public knowledge, but I&#x2019;d assured Lily that Macey was safe with her father, who disappeared with her during a weekend visitation, and I&#x2019;d believed it. I had lost touch with Hannah before our marriages fell apart, hadn&#x2019;t been there for her in any way until the awkward pie, and I didn&#x2019;t know what to do for her now. I ached for her, what she must be going through, waiting to hear if the skull belonged to her child.<br><br>&#x201c;You still there?&#x201d; Becca asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They could be wrong.&#x201d; Becca always held out hope for happy endings long after most people gave up, her optimistic gene a fluke in a family of cynics. &#x201c;Maybe the skull&#x2019;s not even human.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; I said, turning my back to the wind, my ears stinging.<br><br>&#x201c;Kendrick might have to cancel your meeting tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I&#x2019;ll let you know.&#x201d; So far, Detective Kendrick hadn&#x2019;t been terribly helpful in our effort to make sense of all the unanswered questions surrounding Shane&#x2019;s death. When I first asked to meet with her, she&#x2019;d told me she had real work to do, as if the sudden passing of a thirty-six-year-old didn&#x2019;t warrant even the briefest examination. True, it wasn&#x2019;t unusual for someone to die young in Cutler County&#x2014;there had been so many overdoses in recent years that an article in <i>The Kansas City Star</i> bemoaned the decimation of the next generation of farmers&#x2014;but our brother wasn&#x2019;t an addict. Kendrick had only agreed to meet with me on the condition that I would stop calling, and now she had every reason to blow me off. As much as I wanted to know what had happened to Shane, I couldn&#x2019;t blame her if the sheriff&#x2019;s department focused its limited resources on the discovery in the woods.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to get inside,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m freezing. I&#x2019;ll drop Gravy off in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>Gravy showed no sign that he heard his name, his attention focused on divining scents in the night air. I bent to pick him up, the one thing guaranteed to rile him, and as he squirmed away from me, I was able to shepherd him back up the hill.<br><br>It was a relief to get out of the wind, even if it wasn&#x2019;t exactly toasty in the drafty farmhouse. I wedged a few sticks and a thick block of wood into the stove and prodded a ball of newspaper into the embers, my cheeks burning as the radiating heat began to thaw them. Ribbons of flame curled up the kindling, persuading the split edge of the log to ignite.<br><br>Shane was the one who had taught me how to make a fire, back when we were kids. We had run away once, when I was six and he was nine, scared that Dad would whip us when he discovered we&#x2019;d knocked Grandma Keller&#x2019;s angel figurine off the living room shelf and broken its wing. It was cold that day, too, and we only made it as far as the field behind the barn. Shane showed me how to build a fire with dead leaves and a rotten branch and the matches he&#x2019;d been clever enough to bring along, and when it turned dark, he sang Christmas songs to keep me from crying, promising to take all the lashes himself if Dad caught us, though I knew it was never that easy. Becca came to find us for supper and led us back to the house, where she unearthed an old tube of superglue and reattached the angel&#x2019;s wing before Dad got home.<br><br>We had our roles, even then. Becca, duty bound, quietly fixing things; Shane, both troublemaker and protector. I was the baby, desperate to grow up and get out, though in the end, I hadn&#x2019;t gotten much farther than when Shane and I had run away&#x2014;the other side of Shade Tree from the house we grew up in.<br><br>I was on the road by daybreak to meet Detective Kendrick before work, dropping Gravy at Becca&#x2019;s house with a bag of pee pads he refused to lie on and a basket of toys that he hadn&#x2019;t touched since he&#x2019;d come to stay with me. Becca and her boys liked having him over to visit&#x2014;having Shane&#x2019;s dog there made it feel like he was still around&#x2014;but I was secretly grateful Becca&#x2019;s husband was allergic, so I could keep Gravy most of the time. He&#x2019;d been a welcome addition, the house too empty now that Lily was staying with her dad during the week to attend the suburban middle school that he&#x2019;d insisted was better than the one in Shade Tree.<br><br>As I started down the highway toward Blackwater, I tuned in to the local talk-radio program, hoping to hear more about the skull in the woods, but there was no new information.<br><br>The leaden sky lightened a few shades as the sun climbed above the dead fields, the towering silos of Sullivan Grain, where my dad had worked until the day he died, rising in the distance. The highway used to run straight through town, but a new spur bypassed it altogether, crossing the river while the old road wound north through Main Street. Blackwater was the county seat and the anchor of our small constellation of Kansas farming towns beyond the Kansas City suburbs, communities connected through high school sports rivalries and livestock auctions and the shared Walmart out on the highway.<br><br>There were no stoplights downtown, only four-way intersections where manners dictated that two drivers arriving at the same time would insist, through a series of patient hand gestures, that the other person go first. Main Street had shriveled as the suburbs expanded their reach and their offerings, but thanks to the grain elevator and the jobs it provided, many local businesses were still thriving, including the Blackwater Diner, the Feed &amp; Supply, and Why Not Donuts, beloved for its old-fashioned cream horns. There were two gas stations on Main, though Casey&#x2019;s was the only one where you&#x2019;d dare use the bathroom&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t unheard-of to find someone passed out on the toilet with a needle jammed in a vein at the Conoco&#x2014;and you couldn&#x2019;t turn your head without seeing a church. It was downright bustling compared to Shade Tree&#x2019;s lifeless town square. If I turned off on a gravel road north of Casey&#x2019;s and followed it past Pettit Brothers Auto Body &amp; Salvage, I would end up at Shane&#x2019;s house, where he had died. Instead, I parked in front of the Cutler County courthouse and headed into the police station to meet Detective Kendrick.</p><h2>James Thurber: 92 Stories (with Original Drawings)</h2><p>Gathers humorous stories, essays, and drawings about the battle between the sexes, marriage, pets, and the trials of modern life</p><p></p><h2>Flinx Transcendent: A Pip &amp; Flinx Adventure</h2><p>From one of the most brilliant imaginations in science fiction comes <b>Flinx Transcendent</b>, Alan Dean Foster&#x2019;s thrilling conclusion to the series that began over thirty-five years ago&#x2013;the epic adventures of Flinx and his flying minidrag companion, Pip.<br><br>Flinx is the only one with even the tiniest chance of stopping the evil colossus barreling in to destroy the Humanx Commonwealth (and everything else in the Milky Way). With time running out, Flinx is a man in search of a solution and in search of himself. His efforts take him to the land of his mortal enemies, the bloodthirsty AAnn, where chances are excellent that Flinx&#x2019;s discovery&#x2013;and summary execution&#x2013;will eliminate all his demons and doubts in one masterstroke.<br><br>The way Flinx is feeling, that might not be the worst imaginable end. After years of searching for his father, he finally has&#x2013;and must bear&#x2013;the truth. And now he must also seek out an ancient sentient weapons platform wandering around somewhere in the galaxy and then communicate with it, a powwow that could very well fry his already frazzled brain. Then there are the oblivion-craving assassins determined to stop Flinx before he can prevent total annihilation.<br><br>With a future that rosy, it&#x2019;s no surprise he&#x2019;s flirting with disaster. Still, Flinx is no quitter, and he&#x2019;s got something else going for him&#x2013;an uncanny ability to improvise and triumph (or at least survive) in impossible situations. He&#x2019;s certainly been through enough of them, and now he&#x2019;s going to need every ounce of that know-how, because he&#x2019;s venturing to places where the laws of physics fear to tread, where no one&#x2019;s ever been, to do what no one&#x2019;s ever done, and where his deadliest enemy is so close it&#x2019;s invisible.</p><p>Alan Dean Foster has written in a variety of genres, including hard science fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He is the author of the New York Times bestseller <b>Star Wars: The Approaching Storm</b><i> </i>and the popular Pip &amp; Flinx novels, as well as novelizations of several films, including <i>Transformers, Star Wars,</i> the first three Alien films, and <i>Alien Nation</i>. His novel <i>Cyber Way</i> won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction, the first science fiction work ever to do so.

He is currently at work on several new novels and media projects.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>Insofar as he knew, Flinx was the first unofficial, uninvited representative of his species to set foot on the AAnn homeworld of Blasusarr. Very few humans and even fewer thranx had ever been formally accredited to do so. Only the minimum number essential to facilitate those few diplomatic exchanges where electronic representations were insufficient and face-to-face conversation was demanded had ever been allowed actual physical access. The idea that a single human operating entirely on their own might somehow succeed in penetrating the elaborate and extensive defenses that redundantly englobed Blasusarr was sufficiently ludicrous to promulgate all by itself entire new orders of cognitive absurdity. Everyone knew that no non-AAnn ship could so much as approach the outskirts of the homeworld system without being challenged&#x2014;or blown to bits.<br><br>However, the AAnn scientists and engineers who had designed and built those impressive planetary defense systems had never envisioned a ship like the Teacher. In their defense, neither had anyone else.<br><br>Wrought with all the exponentially developing skills the energetic and enthusiastic Ulru-Ujurrians had been able to muster, Flinx&#x2019;s vessel was imbued throughout its body with the chameleonic ability to so completely transform its appearance that one moment it could present the perfect likeness and detection signature of a private passenger craft, and the next that of a heavily armed military escort. Now settled in unobtrusive orbit around the AAnn homeworld, it displayed the convincing aspect of a minor clan AAnn cargo vessel. Furthermore, it was not the only persuasive transformation to have taken place in that vicinity. There was also the elaborate and difficult provisional makeover Flinx had devised for himself.<br><br>So accomplished was the result that he had been on Blasusarr for a local teverravak, or sixteen days, without drawing more than the occasional casual glance. Perfectly fashioned though it was, the simsuit that enveloped him completely would have been inadequate to sustain the ruse had he not been so knowledgeable in the ways of the quasi-reptilians among whom he moved. He knew how to emulate the loping AAnn gait, which involved bending slightly at the knees and invigorating each step with a slight hopping motion; was intimately familiar with their eloquent repertoire of communicative hand gestures; could eat their food (though the profoundly carnivorous diet was beginning to have adverse effects on his waistline); and through the use of tiny but powerful integrated servos lodged in the suit&#x2019;s hindquarters was even able to satisfactorily manipulate its integrated lightweight tail. Built-in nanoneuromatics operated the double eyelids. Having to view the world through their slitted pupils somewhat restricted his peripheral vision, but the result was more than adequate. He saw everything that threatened to trip him.<br><br>Thus camouflaged and experienced he passed freely if cautiously among his unknowing hosts, the loose spaces and the specially constructed sleeping pocket within the suit providing ample room for Pip to both rest and move about while retaining a certain amount of freedom.<br><br>Not even the operators of the subsurface transient burrow where he had rented living space suspected that he was anything but a nye: a fully mature adult AAnn. Utilizing a mastery of his hosts&#x2019; language that was rare among his kind while keeping conversation to a minimum, he found himself accepted by his fellow burrow-dwellers as one of their own. He even took care to make appropriate use of the sand room in his quarters, remembering before departing each day to leave the suitably scaly impression of his simsuit on the heated surface.<br><br>Thankfully, the suit&#x2019;s thermosensitive cooling system was up to the task of coping with Blasusarr&#x2019;s demanding climate. The AAnn had evolved on a desert world. While Flinx normally would have had no trouble tolerating the forty-degree dry heat, any other kind of completely enclosed suit would have rendered it unbearable. Cocooned within its technologically advanced confines he stayed cool, reasonably comfortable, and could do most anything an AAnn could do without revealing his human identity. Eating, drinking, and voiding were the chief exceptions. He sustained his masquerade by making sure to perform such necessary functions only in private and under carefully controlled conditions.<br><br>Capital city of Blasusarr and therefore the entire AAnn empire,<br><br>Krrassin was an immensely spread-out metropolis of long, low buildings punctuated only by the occasional unavoidable tower. While humans favored the view to be had from on high and the thranx chose where possible to cluster together belowground, having evolved from burrow-ambush predators the AAnn still preferred to live and work just below and just above the surface. The ideal AAnn dwelling was one partially subterranean but featuring long, narrow windows that provided a view exactly at ground level. In a city the size of Krrassin such panoramas were scarce and available only to the most privileged. Those forced to live high above the ground or deep below the surface had to make do with virtual visuals.<br><br>Having mastered their harsh environment, the majority of AAnn spent the bulk of their waking hours living and working within the vast interconnected warren that was the Great Burrow of Krrassin. Those who ventured outside on foot did so on external pedestrian walkways that, following tradition, crisscrossed the city in a succession of sweeping, concentric S-curves.<br><br>It was down one such gently curving avenue that Flinx presently found himself strolling. He kept to the extreme right or the left, avoiding the center path that was reserved for those citizens who wished to engage in ceremonial aggression; whether for purposes of social interaction, striving for the kind of upward mobility that motivated all AAnn, or as a preliminary to deeper and more personal interrelationships that extended to but did not necessarily include procreation.<br><br>Sometimes several fights were in progress at the same time. It was not unusual for these to involve members of both sexes. Only rarely did they draw the attention of the preoccupied passersby who kept to the concord walks that flanked the contested middle walkway. The majority of these confrontational encounters were highly ritualized, though actual physical contact was common enough. By walking the center path and facing up to come what may, be it hostile, sexual, or social, combatants acquired status. Such status was recorded and cumulative. It was one very public way an individual AAnn could rise within the social order without being born into an aristocratic family. As he strove to blend ever deeper into AAnn society Flinx often scrutinized such confrontations with intense interest. It was good that he did.<br><br>Because on his eleventh day on Blasusarr the forcefully side- switching tail of a carelessly hurrying worker accidentally jostled Flinx off the left-hand walkway and straight onto the always contentious, ever challenging Middle Path.<br><br>Unlike the wide and winding pedestrian avenues that flanked it to left and right, the center core was not paved, unless one counted as pavement the expertly stylized and sterilized sand that had been imported to fill the gently meandering, slightly depressed four-meter- wide walkway. Flinx&#x2019;s clawed, sandal-shod AAnn &#x201c;feet&#x201d; slipped slightly in the soft sand as he fought to recover his footing. In the process they smeared the intricate whorls, ripples, and other imaginative patterns both traditional and contemporary that automated preprogrammed sand-grooming machinery incised anew every morning for the enjoyment and edification of passing nye. Recovering his balance as he straightened, he prepared to step back onto the right-side concourse.<br><br>Only to find his way blocked.<br><br>The lightly clad, iridescently scaled challenger was male, his stance unapologetically belligerent. Like any other nye one was likely to encounter on the Middle Path, he was looking for trouble. Were he not, he would have been striding along on the peaceful left or right walk and not in the sand-filled center. Flinx immediately tensed. At least his antagonist was not an aroused female looking to partner. The ingenious simsuit Flinx wore could replicate many aspects of AAnn physical behavior, but reptiloid intercourse was not one of them.<br><br>It was to be straightforward physical confrontation, then. To what end and what degree he had yet to find out. Within the suit he could feel Pip&#x2019;s coils contracting around his shoulder as she sensed and responded to her master&#x2019;s heightened anxiety. Controlling his emotions, he did his best to calm her. Having to restrain her while he was engaged in combat was a complication he had learned how to deal with as a child. How difficult it was going to be on this particularly dangerous occasion depended largely on his adversary&#x2019;s intentions. With no status at risk Flinx was perfectly content to let his opponent triumph. The one thing he could not chance was damage to the concealing simsuit and subsequent revelation of his true identity. With luck and caution it would not come to that.<br><br>&#x201c;Sspawn of Zithanitese,&#x201d; the big male hissed at him. The slur was accompanied by a gesture of third-degree contempt. Nothing too serious, Flinx decided as he analyzed the insult. It was too soon to relax, though. He had to respond appropriately and believably while ensuring that the confrontation did not escalate. He explored his considerable vocabulary of AAnn invective, seeking just the right balance between defiance and deference.<br><br>&#x201c;Ssoured in the egg ssoundss ssuch,&#x201d; he retorted, upthrusting and bringing his simsuit-clad right arm around and down in a sweeping motion indicative of second-degree disrespect. It was an appropriately robust response, but not one so forceful as to invite the drawing of personal weaponry. As he swung his arm he was careful not to activat...</p><h2>Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators in The Mystery of the Purple Pirate</h2><p>Searching for a legendary pirate treasure, the three investigators find a band of modern day pirates.</p><p></p><h2>Step-By-Step Drawing Book (Activity Books for Little Children)</h2><p>Discover how to draw lots of things by following the simple step-by-steps in this delightful book, which has space for you to draw in.

Bursting with over 25 impressive pop-ups, this deluxe format features a variety of unique novelty elements-including a light-up Bat-Signal, a cosmic Justice League of America battle scene, a twirling Lasso of Truth, and a transparent Invisible Jet! With vibrant illustrations, exciting facts, and an eye-catching design, this is an absolute must-have for DC Super Hero fans of all ages!</p><p>Matthew Reinhart has created many bestselling, award-winning pop-up books, including <em>Star Wars: The Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy</em>; <em>Brava, Strega Nona!;</em> and <i>Mommy?</i> by Maurice Sendak and Arthur Yorinks. A graduate of the Pratt Institute, he is the co-creator with Robert Sabuda of the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling <em>Encyclopedia Prehistorica </em>pop-up series. Matthew lives in New York City. <br><br>With a publishing history that spans over seventy years, DC Comics is best known as the home of the world's most famous super hero characters, including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Plastic Man - and literally thousands more. These characters have provided the inspiration for numerous movies, television shows, and even Broadway musicals, and are universally recognized and beloved by fans worldwide and of all ages.Gr 2-5&#x2013;Pop-up-meister Reinhart incorporates images created by a number of DC artists into a set of spectacular 3-D portraits&#x2013;both the sort that leap up in massively muscled splendor from the center of each spread and smaller but no less eye-popping figures tucked into folding booklets in the corners. Superman leads off, of course, a solar-powered &#x201c;living symbol of truth, justice, and the American way&#x201d; towering over a view of his spacecraft while escaping an exploding Krypton on one side, and, on the other, cameos by a trio of sidekicks, plus Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and (temporary) nemesis Doomsday. The Man of Steel is followed by Batman (with battery-powered Bat-Signal), &#x201c;Warrior Goddess&#x201d; Wonder Woman, the squad of intergalactic Green Lanterns, Lord Darkseid (in a spread devoted to the Bad Guys), and, finally, a 45-character composite of the Justice League of America and its prominent adversaries complete with a numbered legend. Other heroes and villains from Captain Marvel, Teen Titans, and even the Justice Society of America to the Joker and Anti-Monitor take bows in the side galleries. The lettered captions are too concise to get into much detail about, for instance, the &#x201c;Infinite Crisis&#x201d; story line but do clearly explain the origins and powers of the major DC players.&#x2013;John Peters, formerly at New York Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2010.

Newly available in paperback, this book demonstrates the power of bodywork in altering the course of a wide range of ailments and provides the most authoritative account of the body&#39;s response to touching. Illustrations.</p><p>Deane Juhan, who taught many years at Esalen, lives in Mill valley and conducts professional classes worldwide for Trager and other bodyworkers.Juhan examines the physiology and psychology of our response to touch, combining excellent illustrations with a detailed but readable technical discussion. Individual sections conclude with his position that through body work, "heightened self-awareness and improved control over conditioned responses" will improve our health and reduce our Job-like suffering. Although Juhan is a professional body worker at Esalen Institute, he does not describe the techniques used and readers will have to test his claims themselves.

Gomes, is an accessible, portable, important introduction to the work of a major religious figure. Newman is one of the few orators of the Victorian era whose sermons still offer themselves to readers as fresh, focused, timely meditations. As Gomes notes in his introduction, "Newman's prose has good bones." Although this volume contains many of Newman's poems and meditations (many of which record the spiritual transformations wrought in him by a trip to Italy in 1832-33), most of the material collected here is sermons. <p> Newman was preacher to the University Church at Oxford, so his sermons address the "big questions" that eternally vex undergraduates--Who is God? How am I to live? Who was Jesus? Newman's answers are straightforward yet sophisticated, and very often grounded in ethics. "Outward acts, done on principle, create inward habits. I repeat, the separate acts of obedience to the will of God, good works as they are called, are of service to us, as gradually severing us from this world of sense, and impressing our hearts with a heavenly character," he writes, in a sermon called "Holiness Necessary for Future Blessedness." Newman's preoccupation with ethics intensified after his conversion from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism in 1843, along with his growing conviction that life in this world is best understood as preparation for life in the next one. Gomes observes that, "For Newman the only security in this world of tribulation is the unseen reality of the spiritual world, a world which (sic) is ruled by Christ, and for which Christ gave himself up for our redemption, which act is recapitulated in the sacramental life of the believer." Newman's sermons, with their astringent ethical focus, were in part a reaction to the increasing secularism and materialism of the 19th century. (He lived from 1801-1890.) In this regard, our <i>fin de si�cle</i> echoes his and makes a contemporary reader's attention to his sermons all the more urgent and rewarding. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>"Newman is one of the greatest of all spiritual writers, a master of English prose and an incomparable expositor of the mysteries of God and creation. This wonderful collection captures the heart of his eloquence and warmth. A superb achievement."<br>------- Philip Zaleski, editor of THE BEST SPIRITUAL WRITING SERIES<br><br>"I would feel presumptuous in recommending John Henry Newman. It is like saying Mozart is a great composer. One can only acknowledge that Newman is one of the spiritual masters of world history, and express gratitutde for this intelligent selection from the feast of his genius."<br>-------- The Reverend Richard John Neuhaus, President of The Religion and Public Life Institute<br></p><h2>Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio</h2><p>In a riveting story of courage and hope, Peg Kehret tells of months spent in a hospital when she was 12, first struggling to survive a severe case of polio, then slowly learning to walk again.

HC: Tor.</p><p><p>Paul Boehmer is a seasoned actor who has appeared on Broadway, film, and television, including The Thomas Crown Affair and All My Children. Coinciding with another of his passions, sci-fi, Paul has been cast in various roles in many episodes of Star Trek.</p>Thrown into the alternative universe of 14th-century England, 20th-century mathematician Jim Eckert and his new wife, Angie, have become Sir James, Baron de Bois de Malenconti, and Lady Angela. They are learning how to live and govern in the medieval era, coping as well with the local dragons and other magical manifestations. Suddenly finding himself transformed into a dragon, Jim turns to S. Carolinus, his magician neighbor, who takes him on as an apprentice. When Prince Edward is captured by the French at the Battle of Poitiers, Jim, submitting to feudal pressure, sets out with some companions from his earlier adventures, including the wolf Aargh, to join the English forces. He is chosen for a special mission that involves penetrating the castle of the evil sorcerer Malvinne, councillor to the king of France, where the prince is being held. During ensuing events, Jim finds that he has become chief pawn in a battle with the Dark Powers--with far-ranging consequences. Dickson has further developed the intriguing medieval universe he posited in the first volume of the series ( The Dragon and the George ) giving reality and texture to the actual life of the time while exploring the effects of magic. The scenes describing diplomatic relations among the dragons are particulary fine. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Back (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><i>Back</i> is the story of Charley Summers, who is back from the war and a POW camp having lost the woman he loved, Rose, to illness before he left and his leg to fighting. In other words, Charley has very little to come back to, only memories, and on top of that he has been deeply traumatized by his experience of war. Rose&#x2019;s father introduces him to another young woman, Nancy, and Charley becomes convinced that she is in fact Rose and pursues her. <i>Back</i> is at once a Shakespearean comedy of mistaken identities, a voyage into the world of madness, and a celebration of the improbable healing powers of love.</p><p><b>Henry Green</b> (1905&#x2013;1973) was the pen name of Henry Vincent Yorke.

They just need the tools that are right for them." Such is the organizing principle of <i>Alton Brown's Gear for Your Kitchen</i> by the selfsame Alton Brown, star of Food Network's <i>Good Eats</i> as well as award-winning author of <i>I'm Just Here for the Food</i>. It's an interesting, effective principle. It comes from a guy who serves pie with a four-dollar mortar trowel he picked up at the hardware store.<p> Brown's opening challenge is a 60-day, four phase process of ridding your kitchen of all things unused and insignificant--easy on the surface, but tough in the doing. That leaves room for essential gear. And to help make those choices, Brown looks at pots and pans, sharp things (not just knives, but graters, mandolins, and cheese slicers, too), small things with plugs (as in small appliances--from food processors to coffee makers to deep fat fryers), kitchen tools unplugged (those items that fill drawers), storage and containment, and safety and sanitation.</p><p> If this were just an encyclopedia, what an unwholesome bore it would be. But Brown turns this relevant information into a romp. He's talking about the tools he uses, after all, and has no fear of naming likes and dislikes--based on his own experience. He also includes unending side chatter about cutting corners, saving money, and actually putting good tools to work. You'll find recipes throughout, and techniques, too. Like, how to bake a chicken in a flower pot. If you wonder why you would even want to attempt it in the first place, Brown clues you in. <i>Alton Brown's Gear for Your Kitchen</i> is about as guilt free as pleasure will ever get. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Alton Brown is the host of the Food Network's <i>Good Eats</i>. He began his TV career as a cameraman and commercial director, but when e wasn't shooting he was cooking and watching cooking shows, which he thought were dull and uninformative. Tired of the griping, Brown's wife, DeAnna, suggested they do something about it. They moved to Vermont, where Brown attended the New England Culinary Institute. During the years that followed, he concocted a new kind of food show, one that blends wit with wisdom, history with pop culture, and science with common cooking sense. Alton and DeAnna live in the southern United States with their daughter, Zoey, "one worthless hound dog," and an iguana named Spike.</p><h2>Mrs. Tim carries on</h2><p>The second-cousin of Robert Louis Stevenson carries on.</p><p></p><h2>Jacques Pepin&#39;s Table: The Complete Today&#39;s Gourmet</h2><p>Emphasizing lower-calorie, health-conscious cooking, a collection of more than three hundred recipes from all three seasons of the PBS series, Today&#39;s Gourmet, includes menu and wine suggestions and culinary techniques.

MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>Birds of East Africa (Collins Field Guides)</h2><p>Birds of East Africa (Collins Field Guides)</p><p></p><h2>Ten Poems to Say Goodbye</h2><p>In Ten Poems to Say Goodbye, the newest addition to the celebrated Ten Poems series, Roger Housden continues to highlight the magic of poetry, this time as it relates to personal loss. But while the selected poems in this volume may focus upon loss and grief, they also reflect solace, respite, and joy. &nbsp;A goodbye is an opportunity for kindness, for forgiveness, for intimacy, and ultimately for love and a deepening acceptance of life as it is rather than what it was. Goodbyes can be poignant, sorrowful, sometimes a relief, and&#x20ac;&#x201d;now and then&#x20ac;&#x201d;even an occasion for joy. &nbsp;They are always transitions that, when embraced, can be the door to a new life both for ourselves and for others. In this inspiring and consoling volume, Housden encourages readers to embrace poetry as a way of enabling us to better see and appreciate the beauty of the world around and within us.</p><p>ROGER HOUSDEN is the author of <i>Ten Poems to Change Your Life</i>; <i>Ten Poems to Open Your Heart</i>; <i>Ten Poems to Set You Free</i>; <i>Ten Poems to Last a Lifetime</i>; <i>How Rembrandt Reveals Your Beautiful, Imperfect Self</i>; <i>Seven Sins for a Life Worth Living</i>; <i>Saved by Beauty</i>; and the novella <i>Chasing Rumi</i>, and is also the editor of <i>Risking Everything: 110 Poems of Love and Revelation and Dancing with Joy</i>.

How wide does the crack &nbsp; in heaven have to split? &nbsp; What would people look like &nbsp; if we could see them as they are, &nbsp; soaked in honey, stung and swollen, &nbsp; reckless, pinned against time? &nbsp; the dragon&#x2019;s spume &nbsp; The first person I normally greet in the morning is Diego.Today, I look at him with eyes whose vision has been altered by reading thispoem. Diego is from the Yucat�n, but now he makes cappuccino in my local caf�in Sausalito. Diego is irrepressibly happy. We shake hands every day as I ordermy cappuccino. He invariably slides it across the counter to me with someexclamation about how beautiful the day is, whatever the weather. Even if Ihave just walked through a blustery wind and a smattering of rain, it seemschurlish to contradict him, and I can only agree, especially when I know howfar he has cycled in the small hours of the morning to get here. Yes, it is abeautiful day. Always. &nbsp; Today, I take in his tiny Mayan frame; his businesslike vigor; hiskind, open gaze, and I feel what this caf� would be like without him. It wouldbe empty. All the locals are here because of him. Because of his warmth, hiswelcome, his verve. I wonder about the sad stories that hide behind his smile;the journey from his homeland, the family he has left behind, the relatives,perhaps, who never made it across the desert in Arizona. I think of him on hisbicycle at four in the morning, pedaling into the wind all through San Franciscoand over the Golden Gate Bridge while the rest of us are quiet in the sleepingcity. &nbsp; Today, his gesture of sliding the cup over the wooden counter islit for me with an uncommon light&#x2014;the light that glows around someone as yousense that this gesture, that sentence, that smile, that look in the eyes, isalready disappearing out of this moment into the timeless. Gone; gone forever.And yet a trace remains; not in the memory only, but in the feeling heart. Andin the body, too; because when we see and feel like this, we are moved. Forwhat is illuminated is the reality that, even as it disappears, the mostordinary gesture can convey the truth and beauty of a human life. I feelgrateful for Diego&#x2019;s courage, his vulnerability to &#x201c;the dragon&#x2019;s spume&#x201d;; awareof his humanity as I am now streaming across the counter to me along with mycoffee. &nbsp; Aware as I am, too, of my own vulnerability, and that of everyoneelse in this caf� this morning, washed and tumbling along as we all are in theriver of time, on our way to the endless ocean. Because all of us are here onlyfor the time being; vulnerable, intrinsically vulnerable to old age, sickness,and death. Nothing will save us from this, our common fate. However puffed outour chest may be, however booming that voice of ours, however many tallbuildings or stocks we own, we, too, are exquisitely, excruciatingly exposed tothe fact that, sooner or later, our place will be cleared and we will be gone. &nbsp; When we remember this, this poem says, something softens in us. Ourjudgments soften. Our hurry slows down a little, our worries return toproportion. We breathe a little easier. After all, every one of us is in thesame leaky, old boat. Everyone we meet, everyone around us&#x2014;the wise, thefoolish, the saintly, the murderous&#x2014;all of us alive today are heading together,in one great fellowship, toward the final waterfall, even as we argue, lash outat each other, care for each other, love each other, regardless of what it iswe do or don&#x2019;t do. &nbsp; This is why ours is an &#x201c;exquisite&#x201d; vulnerability. It is exquisitebecause it is so touching, so life affirming when we see through the shell of aperson to the tender reality beneath. One of the women I pass in the caf� mostmornings was in the local supermarket the other day. We had sometimes smiled inrecognition, but never spoken. She always seemed busy and brisk to my eye, incharge of her day and what she was doing. When we bumped into each other in thesupermarket I greeted her by saying how colorful she looked in her bright blueshirt. She said her husband had died recently, and it was the first day sincethen that she had felt a little alive. I am so sorry, I said. She burst intotears and clung to my shoulder, sobbing. The wave of her grief washed throughand over me. I had had no idea. I would never have known. She was not in chargeat all. She was just trying to do what she could to get through. &nbsp; It reminded me that all of us are a hair&#x2019;s breadth away fromdeath&#x2014;our own or someone else&#x2019;s&#x2014;at any moment of the day or night. All of us,whatever we may do to conceal it, are as tender inside as the down on asongbird&#x2019;s breast. &nbsp;<p>When a manpulls his wheeled suitcase too slowly through the airport, when the car in front of me doesn&#x2019;t signal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;<br> This is what Ellen Bass is saying in these lines: that our commonvulnerability is palpable even in those who irritate us. They, too, carry thesame mortal wound, and when we see this, we see their essential humanity. Thenwe, too, will have softened our own shell and remembered for a moment who <i>we</i> are, below theparade of our passing concerns. It is always exquisite, to return to ourselves,to that quivering presence, substantial and unsayable; and know ourselves againas if for the first time. &nbsp; The poems of Ellen Bass are always achingly human, just like thisone, and weave often threads of grief and loss with love and starlight. &nbsp;</p><p>Bring meyour pain, love. Spread it out like fine rugs, silk sashes,</p><p>&nbsp;<br> she says, in &#x201c;Basket of Figs.&#x201d;1 &nbsp; In &#x201c;The Moon,&#x201d; she sees it &nbsp;</p><p>framed inthe windshield like a small white shell glued to the blue silk of the afternoon.2</p><p>&nbsp;<br> This is one of the many wonderful things about a poem: you can poureverything into it, joy and sorrow, the remarkable and the ordinary, and thepoem will use all of it, turning stones into bread along the way. Just as in&#x201c;If You Knew,&#x201d; even the man wheeling his suitcase through an airport and eventhe clerk in the pharmacy who won&#x2019;t say &#x201c;Thank you&#x201d; come newly alive for uswhen we remember that they, too, like us, are drifting toward an irrevocablefinality. Bass is affirming that we are most alive when we are aware of theshadow of death that hovers over everything and perhaps especially overourselves. It is our mortality that makes life so precious. &nbsp; She brings this vividly into focus in the following stanza, whichmoves us from the general to the specific. She shares a graphic, startlingimage from her own life: &nbsp;</p><p>a young gayman with plum black eyes, joked as he served the coffee, kissed her aunt&#x2019;s powdered cheek when they left.</p><p>&nbsp;<br> The waiter has an air of spontaneity, and an almost femininebeauty, which is not insignificant to my mind. It suggests an ease withrelatedness, with the warmth of contact, with life itself. He needs only wingsto be a personification of Eros, the joyous, life-giving energy of delight anddesire. And what a blessing he gives her, unknowingly&#x2014;for he is the last personto touch the aunt, who walks out of the restaurant and drops down dead alongthe street. She was blessed with the touch of life just as she was leaving it.And he, too, was blessed without knowing it, as we are whenever we extend ourhand in kindness or in generosity toward the transient, fragile life ofanother. &nbsp; The last four lines are an accumulation of successively potentimages, ending with one of the most arresting pictures of the human condition Ihave ever encountered: &nbsp;</p><p>What wouldpeople look like if we could see them as they are, soaked in honey, stung and swollen, reckless, pinned against time?</p><p>&nbsp;<br> Imagine looking at yourself in the mirror, or at your lover or yourparents, and seeing someone &#x201c;soaked in honey, stung and swollen.&#x201d; How forgivingyour look would become, the lines in your face softening already in the glow ofthe truth before you. The phrase reminds me of that beautiful image of AntonioMachado&#x2019;s: &nbsp;</p><p>And thegolden bees were making white combs and sweet honey from my old failures.3</p><p>&nbsp;<br> When I first heard Machado&#x2019;s lines, they broke open my mind to awhole new way of seeing my life. I was in amazement. Imagine the possibilitythat every single turn of events, however dark or disappointing the outcome,can in some circuitous way be the raw material for something that eventuallysurfaces with the sweetness of honey. Machado is saying that your failures cansoften you, render you more permeable to worlds you may never have countenancedif you had always met with success in the world of action. The heart, like thegrape, is prone to delivering its harvest in the same moment that it appears tobe crushed. The beehive in your heart is humming precisely because of thosefailures. &nbsp; Ellen Bass, too, couples our sweetness with our stung and swollenselves. Like the Japanese, who have developed an entire philosophy&#x2014;wabisabi&#x2014;around the value of imperfection, she joins our beauty to our wounding.The &#x201c;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,&#x201d; as Hamlet puts it, can serve tounveil the inherent sweetness of our essential nature. &nbsp; And our greatest wounding, the imperfection that no amount ofprayer or goodness or psychotherapy will ever do anything to erase, is that weare &#x201c;pinned against time.&#x201d; Time is both our friend and our ultimate demise. Itis our friend when we awaken to the reality that this life will not always be so. When we know this from the inside, the caution that mayhave colored our days will dissolve like mist over the bay. With nothing tolose, knowing there can be nothing to hold on to, we can fall headlong into life at last;&#x201c;reckless,&#x201d; like butterflies still hovering over a flower even as the collectorleans forward with his net. &nbsp; Far from being a tragedy, there is something poignantly wondrousabout our mortal predicament. Czeslaw Milosz, in his poem, &#x201c;Encounter,&#x201d;captures it beautifully: &nbsp;</p><p>O my love,where are they, where are they going The flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles. I ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder.4</p><p>&nbsp;<br> I wish only that I might live out my days like this, &#x201c;in wonder.&#x201d; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; LOVE SONNET XCIV &nbsp; by Pablo Neruda &nbsp; If I die, survive me with such sheer force &nbsp; that you waken the furies of the pallid and the cold, &nbsp; from south to south lift your indelible eyes, &nbsp; from sun to sun dream through your singing mouth. &nbsp; I don&#x2019;t want your laughter or your steps to waver, &nbsp; I don&#x2019;t want my heritage of joy to die. &nbsp; Don&#x2019;t call up my person. I am absent. &nbsp; Live in my absence as if in a house. &nbsp; Absence is a house so vast &nbsp; that inside you will pass through its walls &nbsp; and hang pictures on the air. &nbsp; Absence is a house so transparent &nbsp; that I, lifeless, will see you, living, &nbsp; and if you suffer, my love, I will die again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if i die &nbsp; There is a power, a force in this poem that runs like ariver down from the first line to the last and that carries over the love ofone person to another even beyond the frontiers of death. If someone is readingyou this poem as lover to beloved, take in the words as a message from yourlover&#x2019;s heart to yours, Neruda&#x2019;s sonnet being the bird that sings to you. Evenif you are alone, you can say this poem out loud to yourself, and know thatyour life can continue through the life and presence of others who will surviveyou. &nbsp;</p><p>If I die, survive me with suchsheer force that you waken the furies of the pallid and the cold,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Survive me with such sheer force,&#x201d; Neruda urges his beloved, thateven the dead are shaken awake. It is a tidal wave of living that he is callingfor; nothing less will serve. No mere living on in memory of what was, nodrifting through the days trying to pick up the pieces of a life shattered bythe death of a beloved. In these first few lines I almost wonder if what Nerudawants is his revenge on Death itself. He certainly wants his love to bedeathless, to continue on through the sheer vigor and vitality of the way hisbeloved lives her life after he has gone. There is more than a tinge ofdefiance here&#x2014;he even says &#x201c;If I die,&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;When I die,&#x201d; which would bethe more accurate phrase, and which reminds me of those famous lines of DylanThomas: &nbsp;</p><p>Do not go gentle into that goodnight, Old age should burn and rage at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.1</p><p>&nbsp;<br> Yet where Neruda departs from Thomas is in the loving melody thatwhispers here beneath the surface of the defiance. Neruda cares so deeply forthe one he expects to leave behind that he offers this poem to her as a strongwind in her sails while she continues on her voyage through life. This is whatI can hear, a siren call ringing all the way through from beginning to end: hislove for her is so great, so passionate, so unstoppable that he wants to pour itinto her so that she may live large enough for both of them when he is gone. &nbsp; Later, looking down on her with the empty gaze of the dead, hewould not have been disappointed. The lover who Neruda addresses in this poemwas the Chilean singer Matilde Urrutia. His <i>OneHundred Love Sonnets,</i> which includes this one, was published in1960, when Neruda was in his fifties. It was dedicated to Matilde, with whom hehad a clandestine relationship for the last eight years of his marriage to theArgentinian painter Delia del Carril, who was twenty years his senior. &nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Deep End (The Country Club Murders)</h2><p><p><b>INTRIGUING PLOT, FASCINATING CHARACTERS...</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;Part mystery, part women&#x2019;s fiction, part poetry, Mulhern&#x2019;s debut, <i>The Deep End</i>, will draw you in with the first sentence and entrance you until the last.

That's the situation that Diana Wynne Jones explores in <i>Dark Lord of Derkholm</i>, and she makes an effective and comical tale of it. <p> Groups of tourists, called Pilgrim Parties and organized by the cold-hearted profiteer Mr. Chesney, take a portal to the magical realm, where they are shepherded about the countryside by a wizard guide. Mr. Chesney sets the rules, such as that all wizard guides must have long white beards--even 14-year-old Blade--and every Party gets to "slay" the Dark Lord. No wizard wants to be chosen as the year's Dark Lord, because Mr. Chesney demands large battles that cause great devastation in the local villages and farms, and he doesn't pay very well, but he does have a captive demon to enforce his will. This year, things are going especially badly for the chosen Dark Lord, Derk. He can't seem to keep his evil forces on the right track, despite help from his son Blade, his daughter Shona the bard, and his griffin sons and daughters. His chief aide, Barnabas, is drinking heavily and muddling his spells. And the dwarfs are taking their baskets of gold as tribute to the one they say is the real Dark Lord--Mr. Chesney. </p><p> Jones spoofs many of the trappings of fantasy epics, while at the same time portraying a family, with its surface squabbles and underlying love, through a rollicking and somewhat unwieldy story. Her messages about exploitation and responsibility come through clearly.

In Her Own Words...<p>"I decided to be a writer at the age of eight, but I did not receive any encouragement in this ambition until thirty years later. I think this ambition was fired-or perhaps exacerbated is a better word-by early marginal contacts with the Great, when we were evacuated to the English Lakes during the war. The house we were in had belonged to Ruskin's secretary and had also been the home of the children in the books of Arthur Ransome. One day, finding I had no paper to draw on, I stole from the attic a stack of exquisite flower-drawings, almost certainly by Ruskin himself, and proceeded to rub them out. I was punished for this. Soon after, we children offended Arthur Ransome by making a noise on the shore beside his houseboat. He complained. So likewise did Beatrix Potter, who lived nearby. It struck me then that the Great were remarkably touchy and unpleasant (even if, in Ruskin's case, it was posthumous), and I thought I would like to be the same, without the unpleasantness.</p><p>"I started writing children's books when we moved to a village in Essex where there were almost no books. The main activities there were hand-weaving, hand-making pottery, and singing madrigals, for none of which I had either taste or talent. So, in intervals between trying to haunt the church and sitting on roofs hoping to learn to fly, I wrote enormous epic adventure stories which I read to my sisters instead of the real books we did not have. This writing was stopped, though, when it was decided I must be coached to go to University. A local philosopher was engaged to teach me Greek and philosophy in exchange for a dollhouse (my family never did things normally), and I eventually got a place at Oxford.</p><p>"At this stage, despite attending lectures by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, I did not expect to be writing fantasy. But that was what I started to write when I was married and had children of my own. It was what they liked best. But small children do not allow you the use of your brain. They used to jump on my feet to stop me thinking. And I had not realized how much I needed to teach myself about writing. I took years to learn, and it was not until my youngest child began school that I was able to produce a book which a publisher did not send straight back.</p><p>"As soon as my books began to be published, they started coming true. Fantastic things that I thought I had made up keep happening to me. The most spectacular was<i> Drowned Ammet</i>. The first time I went on a boat after writing that book, an island grew up out of the sea and stranded us. This sort of thing, combined with the fact that I have a travel jinx, means that my life is never dull."</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is the author of many highly praised books for young readers, as well as three plays for children and a novel for adults.

There was the promise of power once again. The plant was being repaired and it looked as though it may actually run. While it meant lots of hard sweaty work; the reward was worth the investment. The farm was growing strong and community involvement was good. People were finally coming to terms with the fact that they needed to work together. So far Mother Nature had been on their side. But that too was about to change. There was no shortage of problems. There were those in town with their own plans. And those plans did not include Sheriff Morgan Carter. For the most part Morgan ignored the issue, thinking it would simply go away. But that was not to be and he would have to face it head on and it just may cost him his life. As serious as the issues in town were, there were other, much larger problems brewing. These were beyond his control. They were beyond the control of the entire community even if they were banded together. And Morgan would not be able to simply ignore them either. There were forces converging on Central Florida that would bring back the uncertainty that only recently appeared to be vanquished. Only this time it would be far worse than a rogue band of Federal Agents. War was coming, and with it death. It would test them all.</p><p></p><h2>The Popular Bible Prophecy Commentary: Understanding the Meaning of Every Prophetic Passage (Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library&#x2122;)</h2><p><p>This much-anticipated new addition to the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library series provides lay-level Bible commentary on all the key prophetic passages in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.

The place where she had lived and worked for a long time now always offered more than enough new experiences and adventures. The country and the region were not the ones in which she had been born, and starting in childhood she had lived in several altogether different lands and landscapes.Raised by grandparents who were avid travelers, or vagabonds, to be more precise, who seemed to change their nationality with every border they crossed, she had pined for a while in her youth for the long-lost land of her birth in eastern Germany, familiar to her not from her own memories but rather from stories, and later from dreams as well.After several visits to that country, she then spent some years there as a student, in Dresden or Leipzig, let us say, a good hour by bicycle from the village of her birth, and eventually, several countries or two or three continents later, she even settled there, two hours by car from her alleged birth house, by now torn down and replaced by a new building. She lived there and worked, though not yet in banking.Later still, again after several countries and continents, after alternating between work and the vagabond life, though not the same kind as her grandparents'--almost always alone--she gradually, imperceptibly, lost track of her birthplace, and one day the image of an expansionist, overweening Germany was gone from her consciousness, whereas for a while at least some traces of her own, small-caliber Germany lingered, a stream with the shadows of water-skaters on its pebbly bed, a harvested cornfield from whose furrows bits of chaff swirled into the air, a mulberry sapling that had wandered by mistake into that steppe-cold region.And then these traces, too, faded away. The images no longer came of their own accord. She had to make an effort to summon them. And as aresult they remained devoid of meaning. At most they turned up in an occasional dream. And eventually they, too, vanished from her dreams. That country no longer pursued her. She did not have a country of her own, or another country either, including this one here. And that was fine with her. Perfectly fine! The eternities spent in foreign parts seemed to have shaped her, enhancing her beauty, and not only the beauty of her face!A clear, frost-cold night in early January on the outskirts of a northwestern riverport city. What was the name of the city? of the country? The author she had hired to write a book about her undertakings and her adventures had been forbidden from the very beginning to use names. In a pinch he could use place names, but it had to be made clear at once that they were usually false--altered or invented. Here and there the author, with whom she had negotiated a standard delivery contract, would also be free to toss in a real name; in any case, future readers were to confine themselves to following the larger story, and the story and the manner of its telling were calculated to make them free to forget, from the moment they turned the first page, any thoughts they might have had of hunting for clues or sniffing around. If possible, the first sentence of her book would banish any such overt or ulterior motives in favor of reading, pure and simple.According to the contract, the same prohibition applied to names of persons and indications of time. Persons' names were admissible only when they were clearly products of the imagination. "What imagination?" (the author).--"The imagination appropriate to the specific adventure, and to love" (she).--"Whose love?"--"Mine. And indications of time only of this sort: One winter morning. On a summer night. The following fall. At Eastertime, in the middle of the war."For a long while now she had had hardly any relatives left. And those who were still alive were out of sight and out of mind. Somewhere --"Where?"--"How should I know?"--she allegedly still had a half brother, who allegedly rented out recreational vehicles, or was a microchip technician? or both?Yet for many years she had made her ancestors, starting with her parents, of whom she had no conscious memories, the objects of a quiet, private, and all the more fervent cult. These ancestors, with the possible exception of her grandparents, who for a long time were entirely too present, constituted--thanks to stories, no matter how fragmentary, indeed, precisely because they were fragmentary, and then also dreams--the lovefor which she wept anew, often daily, during a good "two dozen summers, and even more winters."Did she long for her ancestors? Yes, yet not to be with them, but merely to be able to look in on them for a moment, to comfort them, to thank them, and to bow down before them, after taking the appropriate step backward.And then these shadowy ancestors had lost all their hold over her. And that, too, had happened ever so gradually. Some summer or winter morning she had realized that her venerated dead belonged to the gazillions of those who were no longer present, having seeped into the ground since the dawn of time, crumbled, or blown away to the four corners of the earth, never to be recalled, never to be brought to life by any love whatsoever, irrecoverable for all eternity. They still turned up now and then in dreams, but only as part of a crowd, under the heading of "also present": this "now and then" no longer had the meaning it had once possessed of "at all sacred times."And this second death of her ancestors was also fine with her, like the small and large birth country that had earlier slipped away from inside her. In the meantime she had come to see as delusory the type of strength she had long derived less from the entire country than from little pockets in that country, less from the wholly successful life of an ancestor (to be sure, there was not even one life that fit that description) than from misfortune and a lonely death (which was the lot of all her forebears). Such strength, she wondered: Did it not make one tyrannical and ruthless? Did it not add to the burdens of those with whom one now passed time, lived, worked, had dealings, in the present? Such strength was accompanied by a kind of arrogance, was it not, which could thwart, even harm, even destroy the days as well as the nights of one's contemporaries, those who somehow or other got close to one? Once free of her ancestor worship, did she become receptive to other kinds of strength? impulses? No, in spite of everything, it was not perfectly fine with her when the ancestors grew meaningless and dim. It was more a question of her letting it happen, with a bitter aftertaste, and not only on her tongue.Week after week it had been bone-chillingly cold in this region where she had made her home for a long time now. At first she wanted to talk the author out of any reference to this detail, which hardly seemed to fit the "northwestern port city" they had settled on as her place of residence, a place where the Gulf Stream moderated the climate. But then sheallowed herself to be persuaded that a "port" could also be a riverport, inland, far from the warming coast, on what was already a cold portion of the continent. Basel. Cologne. Rouen. Newcastle upon Tyne. Passau. What mattered: that her bank's headquarters were located in such a city. But the name of the bank was not to be mentioned in her story either.On the morning of her departure she rose even earlier than usual. As before every journey, it had been a light, floating night, perhaps, too, because she had again slept in the bed belonging to her child, who had gone away. Her things were already packed--or rather, stashed in a bag purchased at the end of her girlhood and by now half as old as she was. It seemed immeasurably older, however: worn, torn, scuffed; like a relic from the Middle Ages, when travel had been very different from today; an ermine satchel? Time and again, before each of her solitary journeys, and not only into the Sierra, she had wanted to throw it away, or at least stow it in a corner. And every time it had been the one she decided to take with her--"just once more." As a child, her daughter, long since over the hills and far away, had begged her mother, whenever one of their games came to an end, for this kind of "just one more game," and after that "just one more": "Please, just one more, one more!" This was no longer asking; it was pleading. The author: Could he include that in her book? She: If not that, then what? All through the trip her bag remained half open. But nothing ever fell out. And her shoes? They were old and scuffed--good for rock climbing.It was still completely dark, and outside the frost crackled on the windowpanes. She did not turn on the light; the moon, almost full, though waning, shone through the entire house with its many uncurtained windows. Here on its periphery, the riverport city extended to the foot of a ridge, partly wooded, partly bare cliffs. The hill, black with the moon behind it and very close by, appeared to form part of the spacious house, which at the moment looked empty. In each room--and there were quite a few rooms--the near emptiness projected a different image: here the resident had long since moved out for good; here the room had been cleared out except for two or three objects and pieces of equipment, ready for work to begin; now the deserted vestibule showed signs of a hasty departure; now the table in the parlor gleamed for a meeting about to take place; there, in the kitchen's one pot, the size of a cauldron, food had been prepared for a large gathering, or for a whole week.A sort of fullness or, rather, stuffed quality, similar to that of her bag, manifested itself only in the first of the suite of rooms intended for a toddler, a schoolchild, and a student: even the corners were filled with games, action figures, toys, standing and lying next to and on top of each other.

Winnie-the -Pooh</p><p>Pooh straps on his backpack and goes out searching for honey with his pal Piglet in this adorable new plush toy and board book format.Alexander Lenard was a Hungarian writer, poet, artist, linguist and teacher. His Latin translation of Winnie-the-Pooh, which took seven years to complete, was published in the UK in 1960 and immediately became a bestseller. A.A. Milne wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920. Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). E. H. Shepard famously illustrated both Winnie-the-Pooh and The Wind in the Willows though, like A.

With such strong writers as Richard Peck, Natalie Babbitt, Lloyd Alexander, and Rafe Martin, one would expect nothing less. Strategic placement of genres sustains reader interest. Animals as heroes, time machines as homework helpers, along with Washington Irving's timeless classic Rip Van Winkle and Frank Stockton's highly provocative The Lady or the Tiger? offer many powerful, instantly engaging choices, especially appealing to reluctant readers. Scatterings of the supernatural appear throughout, such as in Patricia McKissack's The Woman in White, in which a desperate ghost propels readers into the injustices of the pre-Civil Rights era. Others are sure to elicit a shiver, like Robert San Souci's The Caller. Brief biographical sketches of the contributors are included. Katherine Paterson offers a persuasive afterword in favor of sharing, discussing, and reading these selections aloud as well as exhorting the dire need for more quality writing in short fiction.<i>&#x2013;D.

This intratextual and intertextual reading of Mark's Gospel helps us to appreciate the literary character, its setting in life, and its distinctive approaches to the Old Testament, Jesus, and early Christian theology.</p><p>"Intratextuality" means we read Mark as Mark and by Mark. Such a reading expresses interest in the final form of the Gospel (not its source or literary history) and in its words and images, literary devices, literary forms, structures, characterization, and plot. Reading Mark by Mark gives particular attention to the distinctive vocabulary and themes that run throughout the Gospel and serve to hold it together as a unified literary production.</p><p>"Intertextuality" comprises the relation between texts and a textual tradition, and also referring to contextual materials not usually classified as texts (e.g., archaeological data). "Intertextuality" is used to note the links of the text of Mark's Gospel to other texts (especially the Old Testament) and to the life of the Markan community and of the Christian community today.</p><p>Chapters are "The Prologue: The Beginning of the Good News (1:1-13)," "Transitional Markan Summary: Proclamation of the Kingdom (1:14-15)," "The Call of the First Disciples (1:16-20)," "A Paradigmatic Day Begins the Ministry of Jesus (1:21-34)," "Highpoints of Jesus' Work in Galilee (1:35-45)," "The Healing of the Paralyzed Man (2:1-12)," "The Call of Levi and Meals with Tax Collectors and Sinners (2:13-17)," "Fasting, Torn Garments, and New Wineskins (2:18-22)," "Plucking Grain of the Sabbath (2:23-28)," "Healing on a Sabbath (3:1-6)," "Transitional Markan Summary: Healing Beside the Sea (3:7-12)," "Choosing the Twelve (3:13-19)," "The Beelzebul Controversy and the True Family of Jesus (3:20-35)," "The Parable of the Sower, Sayings on the Mystery of the Kingdom of God, and the allegory of the Seeds (4:1-20)," "Four Sayings on Revelation and Two Kingdom Parables (4:21-34)," "Jesus 'Power Over the Wind and Waves (4:35-41)," "The Exorcism of the Gerasene Demoniac (5:1-20)," "The Daughter of Jairus and the Woman with the Hemorrhage (5:21-43),""The Rejection at Nazareth (6:1-6a)," "The Mission Charge to the Twelve (6:6b-13)," "The Identity of Jesus and the Execution of John the Baptist (6:14-29)," "The Feeding of the 5000 by the Sea of Galilee (6:30-44)," "Jesus Walks on the Water and Astounds the Disciples (6:45-52)," "A Markan Summary of the Healing Power of Jesus (6:53-56)," "The Dispute over Clean and Unclean (7:1-23)," "The Syrophoenician Woman (7:24-30)," "Jesus Restores Hearing and Speech to a Suffering Man (7:31-37)," "The Second Feeding Narrative: The 4000 (8:1-10)," "Pharisees and Scribes Seek a Sign (8:11-13)," "A Further Misunderstanding by the Disciples and the Conclusion of the Bread Section (8:14-21)," "The Gradual Healing of a Blind Man (8:22-26)," "Peter's Confession, the First Passion Prediction, Peter's Misunderstanding, and the Demands of Discipleship (8:27-38)," "The Transfiguration (9:1-13)," "Healing a Possessed Boy (9:14-29)," "A Second Passion Prediction and More Instructions for Disciples (9:30-50)," "Marriage and Divorce (10:1-12)," "Jesus Blesses Children (10:13-16)," "Riches and Poverty (10:17-31)," "A Third Passion Prediction and More Instructions for Disciples (10:32-45)," "The Healing of Blind Bartimaeus (10:46-52)," "Jesus 'Entry into Jerusalem (11:1-11)," "The Fig Tree and the Temple (11:12-25)," "The Authority of Jesus (11:27-33)," "The Parable of the Vineyard (12:1-12)," "Taxes to Caesar (12:13-17)," "The Debate about Resurrection (12:18-27)," "The Great Commandment(s) (12:28-34)," "The Messiah and the Son of David (12:35-37)," "The Scribes and the Widow (12:38-44)," "Jesus 'Eschatological Discourse (13:1-37)," "Contrasting Beginnings of Jesus 'Last Days (14:1-11)," "Jesus 'Final Meal with His Disciples (14:12-25),""Prediction of Peter's Denial (14:26-31)," "Jesus in Gethsemane (14:32-42)," "The Arrest of Jesus (14:43-52)," "Jesus Before the Sanhedrin and the Denial by Peter (14:53-72)," "Jesus Before Pilate (15:1-20)," "The Crucifixion of Jesus (15:21-32)," "The Death of Jesus (15:33-41)," "The Burial of Jesus (15:42-47)," "The Empty Tomb (16:1-8)," "Later Endings (16:9-20)."</p></p><p>John Donahue, SJ, PhD, is the Raymond E.

He has been practising for more than 20 years, specializing in personal-crisis management. He has a weekly column in The Observer.&#34;Twisted Fables is a thought provoking, inspiring mixture of tales so gratuitously weird that I couldn&#39;t have made them up myself. Instead of imparting some trite platitude, each tale tends to include an improbably named character facing some life changing situation involving drugs, sex, incredible coincidences or a debauched hodge-podge of all three. The character is visited by an angel (barefoot doctor), who dispenses sound spiritual advice, preaches acceptance and tolerance, reaffirms the temporary nature of existence and the wholly oneness of the Tao, and imparts instructions in motivational technique or Taoist exercise, which seem to genuinely work.

Sea captain, privateer, and colonial governor, Woodes Rogers was one of the early eighteenth century&#x2019;s boldest and most colorful characters. <i>Pirate Hunter of the Caribbean</i> is the definitive account of his incredible life.<br><br>At a time when Europe&#x2019;s maritime nations fought over islands and territories, and pirates and other scoundrels were flourishing, Rogers sailed into the center of the action. In 1708, in the midst of Britain&#x2019;s war with Spain, Rogers was hired to lead a mission against Spanish targets in the Pacific. A fearless adventurer who lost his fortune as often as his temper, he battled scurvy and hurricanes and mutinies&#x2014;and along the way captured a treasure galleon and rescued the shipwrecked Alexander Selkirk, whose four-year ordeal on a remote Pacific island inspired Daniel Defoe to write <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.<br><br>When the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 led to an explosion of piracy in the Caribbean, King George I appointed Rogers governor of the Bahamas. There he found himself in charge of a string of islands being plundered by raucous felons, from the notorious &#x201c;Blackbeard,&#x201d; who kept lit matches under his hat to give himself a hellish cast, to Charles Vane, a particularly brutal pirate captain, to Anne Bonny and Mary Read, rare female pirates who escaped the hangman&#x2019;s noose only by revealing their pregnancies.<br><br>With rich and vivid details and plenty of action, David Cordingly chronicles a rollicking adventure that is as fascinating and gripping as any seafaring legend.</p><p><b>David Cordingly </b>was for twelve years on the staff of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, where he was curator of paintings and then head of exhibitions.

The Ypres salient, a small, hilly section of Belgium, witnessed the wholesale destruction of the old British professional army, "the Old Contemptibles"; it was the place where the great armies of England, France, and Germany were locked in a dance of death for four years, where "more than a million soldiers were shot, bayoneted, bludgeoned, bombed, grenaded, gassed, incinerated by flamethrowers, drowned in shell craters, smothered by caved-in trenches, obliterated by underground mines, or, more often than not, blown to pieces by artillery shells." Extraordinary moments occurred in that vast hell, including the renowned Christmas truce of 1914, when the armies set aside the killing for a few short hours, crossed the trenches, and celebrated together. But mostly the scenery was unbeautiful mud and blood, the makings of Groom's chilling canvas, one populated by the famed generals and ordinary soldiers who met in Flanders fields. The stuff of Groom's story will be familiar to readers of Liddell Hart, Keegan, and other scholars, and readers new to the history of the Great War will find it a memorable introduction. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Winston Groom served in Vietnam with the 4th Infantry Division. He is the author of the prize-winning history of the US Civil War SHROUDS OF GLORY. His Vietnam book CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ENEMY was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

Deferred from military service, Chinaski travels from city to city, moving listlessly from one odd job to another, always needing money but never badly enough to keep a job. His day-to-day existence spirals into an endless litany of pathetic whores, sordid rooms, dreary embraces, and drunken brawls, as he makes his bitter, brilliant way from one drink to the next.</p><p>Charles Bukowski's posthumous legend continues to grow. <em>Factotum</em> is a masterfully vivid evocation of slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism, and an excellent introduction to the fictional world of Charles Bukowski.</p></p><p><p>Charles Bukowski is one of America&#x2019;s best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet.

The Bech stories&#x2014;collected in one volume for the first time, and featuring a final, series-capping story, "His Oeuvre"&#x2014;cast an affectionate eye on the famously unproductive Jewish-American writer, offering up a stream of wit, whimsy, and lyric pungency unmatched in American letters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From his birth in 1923 to his belated paternity and public apotheosis as a spry septuagenarian in 1999, Bech plugs away, globetrotting in the company of foreign dignitaries one day and schlepping in tattered tweeds on the college lecture circuit the next.

The authors tackle these and other constitutional issues in this insightful work. The book functions differently than a straightforward explanatory text on the U.S. Constitution. Rather, the authors examine the fissures and issues that arise when it comes to the actual application of the Constitution: Why does a small state have the same power in the Senate as a state with exponentially higher population? How can certain stipulations in the Constitution deter otherwise popular legislation? The text discusses current conflicts, such as the irony of "Taxation Without Representation" in regard to Washington, DC, and Senate filibusters that kill potentially popular legislation before it can even be voted on. Historical situations are also examined, such as the Sedition Act of 1918 that barred anti-war speech during World War One. The book provides readers with a broad context of constitutional law; the text explores how various parts of the U.S. Constitution compare with individual state constitutions and other nations' constitutions. The authors not only raise timely issues, but provide readers with options of how a seemingly obsolete stipulation can be amended. Many examples of amended laws, e.g., the repeal of Prohibition, illustrate the evolving nature of the law. At times, the authors seem to express their support of a more direct democracy. They also provide a "report card" on the Constitution's ability to handle its objectives, such as "Form a More Perfect Union" and "Promote the General Welfare." Pons's helpful illustrations resemble infographics, pulling out startling facts from the text and repackaging them visually.

In a book that spans three decades, author Maeve Binchy follows pale, timid Elizabeth and her red-haired, Irish-Catholic "sister," Aisling, through first loves, weddings, drunken brawls, funerals, and births. Reader Kate Binchy, the author's cousin, nimbly carries the listener from England to Ireland and back again. She casts a warm spell as she makes each character come alive, from Elizabeth's staid father, to her roguish lover, to the Polish merchant who teaches her about valuing herself. Like the title's "penny candle," Binchy's personalities glow lingeringly in the listener's mind.

He is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In his desolate world, which frighteningly mirrors our own, Roland pursues The Man in Black, encounters an alluring woman named Alice, and begins a friendship with the Kid from Earth called Jake. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, &#34;The Gunslinger&#34; leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter.</p><p>Thirty-three years, a horrific and life-altering accident, and thousands of desperately rabid fans in the making, Stephen King's quest to complete his magnum opus rivals the quest of Roland and his band of gunslingers who inhabit the Dark Tower series. Loyal DT fans and new readers alike will appreciate this revised edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i>, which breathes new life into Roland of Gilead, and offers readers a "clearer start and slightly easier entry into Roland's world."<p> King writes both a new introduction and foreword to this revised edition, and the ever-patient, ever-loyal "constant reader" is rewarded with secrets to the series's inception. That a "magic" ream of green paper and a Robert Browning poem, came together to reveal to King his "ka" is no real surprise (this is King after all), but who would have thought that the squinty-eyed trio of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach would set the author on his true path to the Tower? While King credits Tolkien for inspiring the "quest and magic" that pervades the series, it was Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> that helped create the epic proportions and "almost absurdly majestic western backdrop" of Roland's world.</p><p> To King, <i>The Gunslinger</i> demanded revision because once the series was complete it became obvious that "the beginning was out of sync with the ending." While the revision adds only 35 pages, Dark Tower purists will notice the changes to Allie's fate and Roland's interaction with Cort, Jake, and the Man in Black--all stellar scenes that will reignite the hunger for the rest of the series. Newcomers will appreciate the details and insight into Roland's life. The revised Roland of Gilead (nee Deschain) is embodied with more humanity--he loves, he pities, he regrets. What DT fans might miss is the same ambiguity and mystery of the original that gave the original its pulpy underground feel (back when King himself awaited word from Roland's world). <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono.

It is an attempt to set before the reader the &#34;what-happened&#34; of our Revolution in terms of the issues and conflicts that fired the colonists and prodded them to make a new nation. It is a commemoration of how the Americans worked out their political destiny by means of trial and error, success and failure, with all the vices and virtues, shortcomings, sense and nonsense that encumber every such complex undertaking.

It can and should be a glorious and long-awaited day...particularly for those who have watched for his coming and sought to stand in holy places. Living in the Eleventh Hour clearly teaches us what the scriptures as well as Latter-day prophets tell us about the future. It will not only help Latter-day Saints read the signs of the times concerning the last days but also remind us of our personal responsibilities as we prepare ourselves and the world for the much-anticipated return of Christ. Filled with encouraging quotes from Church leaders, insightful scriptures, and personal stories from the author, this timely book will inspire readers to live today as if He were coming tomorrow.</p><p>Robert L.

We enter the apartment block early in the morning, and with each turn of the page, move through the day. The visit finishes in the small hours of the following morning when most of the inhabitants (but not quite all) are asleep. The book tells the story of Dot Splot the artist, Professor Algebrus the inventor, Miss Stella Starspangle and Deirdre Dibble, three families and the caretakers in the basement. While the humans are busy, many animals are weaving their part of the story too.</p><p></p><h2>Cold Fall</h2><p>When a British-owned aircraft is destroyed at Dulles Airport, killing all 439 passengers on board, including his former lover, the Principessa Sukie Tempesta, James Bond embarks on a personal quest to find the fanatical terrorists responsible.</p><p>John Gardner wrote, like Ian Fleming, fourteen James Bond novels (1981 to 1996).

The politics are as steamy as the weather, and the people and places defy generalization. In this handsome and entertaining book, Cyril Vetter gives us passage into that enchanting and wondrous world through a sympathetic and thorough rendering of the lifework of the internationally renowned Baton Rouge photographer Fonville Winans (1911-1992). Celebrated as one of America's best regional photographers, Winans offered a view of Louisiana through a marvelous and eccentric eye, a view that will invoke nostalgic memories for Louisiana natives and introduce others to the magic and beauty of the Pelican State.<br>Fonville Winans' Louisiana contains more than one hundred black-and-white photographs spanning a period of nearly forty years and depicting the politicians, ordinary citizens, and exotic locales that exemplify Louisiana's cultural richness and diversity. During his long career, Winans photographed virtually all of the colorful campaigners who have given the state's politics such a spicy reputation - the legendary brothers Huey and Earl Long; the "singing governor," Jimmie Davis; the archsegregationist and demagogue Leander Perez; the charismatic and controversial Edwin Edwards; and many others.<br>Equally striking are the portraits and candids of everyday people: bartenders and beauty queens, oystermen and inmates, sharecroppers and salt miners, black, white, Cajun, Creole. Taken mainly during the 1930s and 1940s, Winans' photographs of cane fields, fishing camps, festivals, dance halls, paper mills, plantations, swamps, and seascapes show the beauty and simplicity of a mostly rural Louisiana and a time gone by.<br>Accompanying the book is a compact disc that includes the spoken-word recording of Earl K. Long's wit and wisdom entitled Last of the Red Hot Poppas, Huey P. Long singing "Every Man a King," Jimmie Davis crooning "You Are My Sunshine," and other musical selections significant to Louisiana's lively political past.</p><p><p>Cyril E. Vetter, over a twenty-year career in the communications industry, has owned and operated newspapers, radio and television stations, a television production company, a record company, and a music publishing company. He is a graduate of LSU Law School and one of the authors of Requisites for Reform, a study of Louisiana politics written in association with the Council for a Better Louisiana.</p>Prior to his death in 1992, Winans took thousands of photographs of Louisiana's politicians, people, and scenery. This collection of over 100 of his photographs, with commentary by businessman and attorney Vetter, consists primarily of work from the 1930s and 1940s. It is accompanied by a compact disc containing, along with other selections, songs performed by former Louisiana governors Huey Long and Jimmie Davis. Winans's formal studio portraits of political figures are sometimes excessively flattering and reveal little of the subjects' character. But his other work effectively captures the ambiance and culture of French South Louisiana. Some of Winans's best work is also displayed in Myron Tassin's We Are Acadians: Nous Sommes Acadiens (1976). Winans was clearly one of the most talented regional photographers America has produced.

For readers of Bryson's <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i>.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1900, history was an account of great discoveries that actually made sense. People understand innovations like the steam engine, agriculture, or electricity. The twentieth century, by contrast, gave us quantum entanglement, cubism, relativity, psychedelics, postmodernism, chaos maths, and the Somme. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the story of that confusing century as told through the ideas produced at the furthest fringes of our sciences, arts, and culture. Its cast includes well-known geniuses such as Albert Einstein, Francis Crick, and Pablo Picasso, lesser known geniuses like Edward Lorenz, Sergey Korolyov, or Shigeru Miyamoto, and infamous but influential ne'er-do-wells like Timothy Leary, Aleister Crowley and Keith Richards. In this company we take a tour through ideas as strange as general relativity, DNA, the subconscious, Gaia theory, and Dada. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this brilliantly written and original book, John Higgs explores, with great clarity and wit, the extremes of twentieth century thought, and in doing so shows how a world of empires became a world of individuals.

Fabre d'Olivet (1767-1825) was the first to restate Pythagoras' ideas in modern terms, and to show the way for music to regain its spiritual heritage. He calls for a complete reevaluation of its nature and purpose. Fearless in his criticism of the trivialization of music in his own time, d'Olivet recalls its ancient glory in China, Egypt, and Greece. He shows that music is rooted in the same principles as the universe itself, and that it is intimately connected with the destiny of mankind. <br><br>New edition of <i>Music Explained as Science and Art</i>. <br><br>A man of astonishing insights and strange revelations, Fabre d'Olivet is increasingly recognized as an essential link in the golden chain of Western theosophy, and as a prophetic figure with a message for our own age.</p><p>Music scholar and author Joscelyn Godwin provides us with the first English translation of this work, as well as a fascinating biography of the man. Fabre d'Olivet (1767-1825) spent his life pursuing the esoteric wisdom concealed in the Hebrew scriptures, Greek philosophy, and the symbolism of ancient nations as far back as ancient Egypt.

It was among the top five naval battles in history, equal to those of Lepanto, Trafalgar, Jutland, and Midway. The Japanese lost only three destroyers, but the Russians lost twenty-two ships and thousands of sailors. To this day Russian ships throw wreaths on the waves when passing the Korea Strait.The Russians had traveled for nine months to be destroyed in a few hours. Because they were afraid of capture in the Suez Canal, their legendary admiral, dubbed &#34;Mad Dog,&#34; led them on an extraordinary 18,000mile detour from the Baltic Sea, around Europe, Africa, and Asia to the Sea of Japan. They were burdened by the Tsar&#39;s incompetent leadership and the old, slow ships that he insisted be included to bulk up the fleet. Moreover, they were under constant fear of attack, and there were no friendly ports to supply coal, food, and fresh water. The level of self-sufficiency achieved by this squadron was not again attained in naval practice until the Second World War.With a novelist&#39;s eye and a historian&#39;s authority, Pleshakov tells of the Russian squadron&#39;s long, difficult journey and swift, horrible defeat.</p><p>It took the Russians nine months to sail their navy 18,000 miles from the Baltic Sea around the horn of Africa and to the Sea of Japan in 1905, where their Japanese enemies wiped them out in just a few hours at the Battle of Tsushima. The Japanese triumph and Russian disaster, "largely forgotten in the West," according to Constantine Pleshakov, marked a vital turning point in world history. Not only did it inaugurate a new era of naval technology, but it also announced Japan's ascent as a global force (which would culminate during the Second World War) and Russia's collapse into "the dark tsardom of Bolshevism." Pleshakov ranks the battle alongside other classic naval engagements, such as Lepanto, Trafalgar, Jutland, and Midway. Yet the bulk of <i>The Tsar's Last Armada</i> focuses on the Russians' long journey to doom, led by the "frightfully imposing" and "savage" admiral Zinovy Petrovich Rozhestvensky. Pleshakov has a good eye for little details. As the fleet approached the tropics, he reports, the humidity became so bad that the crew's "towels and underwear would not dry." The Battle of Tsushima receives full coverage at the end of the book, but Pleshakov's engaging account of what preceded it is what readers will find most memorable. <i>--John Miller</i>Constantine Pleshakov is a member of the new generation of Russian historians.

A famous horse trainer, known for listening to horses and working with them in a non-confrontational manner, Mark is faced with odd behavior from this horse, and he must reevaluate everything he understands about horses and about himself, as a trainer and as a person. </p><p>Beginning with an untimely balk from Buck, who never falters, Mark tried to find out why it happened. Drawing on experiences as far reaching as the Navajo way and Japanese martial arts, Mark begins to piece together the workings of the mind of his horse. That process and the conclusions he reaches are the heart of this very personal story. </p><p>What he finds challenges him to become a better horse trainer, but it also challenges him to become a better person. His argument that Buck, an everyday horse, has the ability to plan ahead and make choices in a consistent manner will challenge the reader to rethink his or her relationships with animals and way of dealing with life. </p><p>In separate chapters, Mark describes the six life lessons he learned while working with Buck. Later in the book, he puts these lessons into practice, with topics such as blending, balance, and communication. Throughout the book, a philosophy of dealing with horses and of living life itself emerges. </p><p>Mark&#x2019;s inimitable storytelling skills illuminate what Buck has to teach. Heart warming but gritty, Life Lessons From a Ranch Horse is not a conventional horse book. But, then again, Buck is not a conventional horse, nor is his owner a conventional horse trainer.</p></p><p>Mark Rashid is an internationally-acclaimed horse trainer known for his ability to assess situations from a horse&#x2019;s point of view. He has been working with horses since he was ten, and he was especially lucky in his youth to meet a wise "old man" (Walter Pruitt) who taught him to use communication, not force, in working with horses. Ever since, he has committed himself to finding the quiet but effective ways to resolve even the most difficult problems with horses. <p>Rashid gives dozens of clinics each year, as well as private lessons. His clinic format of one-on-one work with horse and rider is immensely popular and has gained him legions of fans around the world. In addition to his clinics, Rashid has presented at such events as the National American Humane Horse Abuse Investigators School, the Colorado Horse Fair, and Equitana USA. He has also been a guest on NPR&#x2019;s The Horse Show, and he&#x2019;s been featured on the Nature series on PBS. His articles have appeared in Western Horseman and Western Horse magazines, as well as other publications, and his books have been translated into German and Swedish. He lives in Estes Park, Colorado.</p></p><h2>Big John&#39;s Secret</h2><p>Mystery surrounds the young peasant boy known as Big John. Raised during the strife-filled days of the reign of King John of England, his life is one day changed when a knight says, in passing, &#x201c;You remind me of someone&#x2014;someone I once knew and loved.&#x201d; It is from &#x201c;Old Marm,&#x201d; the herb woman, that John understands that injustice has been done his family. Though never telling him the family name lest he unwittingly betray himself, she does all she can to prepare him to one day reclaim his name and family honor. Then Old Marm dies, and John is left without a clue to his identity. In the next years John&#x2019;s unusual size and strength and the knowledge he has gained of letters and of the art of healing earn him a place as page to an earl organizing the 5th Crusade. In the Holy Land John searches for a father he hopes is living still. Amidst battle, capture and setbacks, John&#x2014;now a squire to a Knight Hospitaller&#x2014;encounters Francis of Assisi, who had come to the Holy Land just at this time to preach the Gospel to the Saracens. It is another meeting that changes the course of Big John&#x2019;s life. .</p><p>Eleanore M. Jewett was born in New York City in 1890. She found it to be a somewhat lonely city for an only child, but the fact that one side of her family had been there since it was a small Dutch vil�lage made her feel like she &#34;practically owned the place.&#34; Her solitude caused her to create imaginary friends with whom, at around the age of nine, she even formed a literary club. Since young Eleanore was the only one who actually could put pen to paper the club died a natural and early death, but she dates her ambition to write for children from this time. When Mrs. Jewett was doing a Master&#39;s degree in comparative literature at Columbia University she be�came deeply interested in the medieval period, a fasci�nation begun many years earlier after hearing a story about King Arthur. The Hidden Treasure of Glaston, a story of mystery set at Glastonbury Abbey around 1171 in the days of King Henry II of England, and Big John&#39;s Secret,were direct and satisfying results of this interest. The Hidden Treasure received a Newbery Honor in 1947. The truth and nobility which she infused into her historical novels was also something valued in her daily life. Big John&#39;s Secret, whose hero comes to have a deep interest in the art of healing, took inspiration from Mrs. Jewett&#39;s experience as wife of a committed physician. In her dedication to the book she bears witness to this. After their marriage, the Jewetts moved from New York City to a town in upstate New York where they lived with their two daughters. Eleanore Jewett died in 1967, leaving a small but solid contribution to the field of children&#39;s literature.</p><h2>Miro in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, including remainder-interest and promised gifts</h2><p>Published as a tribute to Miro on his eightieth birthday, 140p. 64 illustrations (22 in color). 71 reference illustrations. 2 foldouts.

They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague, where the atmospheric decay of post&#x2013;Cold War Europe is even more cinematically perfect, have it better. Still, they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making. What they actually find is a deceptively beautiful place that they often fail to understand. What does it mean to fret about your fledgling career when the man across the table was tortured by two different regimes? How does your short, uneventful life compare to the lives of those who actually resisted, fought, and died? What does your angst mean in a city still pocked with bullet holes from war and crushed rebellion?<br><br>Journalist John Price finds these questions impossible to answer yet impossible to avoid, though he tries to forget them in the din of Budapest&#x2019;s nightclubs, in a romance with a secretive young diplomat, at the table of an elderly cocktail pianist, and in the moody company of a young man obsessed with nostalgia. Arriving in Budapest one spring day to pursue his elusive brother, John finds himself pursuing something else entirely, something he can&#x2019;t quite put a name to, something that will draw him into stories much larger than himself.<br><br>With humor, intelligence, masterly prose, and profound affection for both Budapest and his own characters, Arthur Phillips not only captures his contemporaries but also brilliantly renders the Hungary of past and present: the generations of failed revolutionaries and lyric poets, opportunists and profiteers, heroes and storytellers.</p><p>In <i>Prague</i>, Arthur Phillips's sparkling, Kundera-flavored debut, five young Americans converge in Budapest in the early 1990s. Most are there by chance, like businessman Charles Gabor, whose parents were Hungarian. But one of them, John Price, has the more novelistic motivation of lost love. He is following his older brother, Scott, intent on achieving an intimacy that Scott, a language teacher and health enthusiast, is just as intently trying to escape. The romantic hero of this unsentimental novel, John Price lives like an expatriate of the 1920s. He longs for experience (and more or less stumbles into a writing job for an English language paper), but even more so for the great, obliterating love that takes the form of the perky assistant Emily Oliver. Mark Payton, a scholar of nostalgia whose insights are touched with mysticism, seems often to speak for the author, even in his barely repressed desire for John Price. For who would not love the good and unaffected, in the confusion, opportunism, and irony that characterize fin-de-si�cle Europe? Phillips's five seekers are like mirrors that reflect Budapest at different angles, and that imperfectly--but wonderfully--point toward the unattainable city: the glittering, distant Prague. <i>--Regina Marler</i>&#x201c;Dazzling...brilliant...the most memorable fiction debut of the year.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;Arthur Phillips&#x2019;s bold and ambitious novel, Prague, is one of those rare books that help define and identify a whole generation, in the same way that Hemingway&#x2019;s The Sun Also Rises introduced his lost generation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Pat Conroy, author of The Prince of Tides<br><br>&#x201c;In Prague, Arthur Phillips spins the Jazz Age novel. His expatriate Americans have settled in Budapest rather than Paris, and instead of champagne and ragtime, they outfit themselves with Gauloises, paprika-dusted sandwiches, punk rock, and post&#x2013;Cold War irony. But their passion&#x2014;to know America and to shrug it off&#x2014;is timelessly literary. A hip-hop remix of Fitzgerald and Hemingway, a meditation on a generation, a polemic, a love story, a new branch of sociology, Prague tries to do it all and succeeds.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Pagan Kennedy, author of Black Livingstone<br><br>&#x201c;An intricate and wordly-wise novel, with sly and acute perceptions on every page, Prague sets itself the challenge of extending the tradition of brainy Central European fiction from an American perspective, and succeeds handily.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Phillip Lopate, author of Portrait of My Body<br><br>&#x201c;Phillips&#x2019;s exhilarating exploration of time, memory, and nostalgia brings to mind such giants as Proust and Joyce.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Library Journal</p><h2>Bomber</h2><p><i>Bomber</i> is a novel about the realities of war.

She teaches writing at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and reviews children&#39;s books for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. She lives in North Little Rock, Arkansas.Ages 3^-7. Little Miguel lives in a New York City apartment with his grandparents and his aunt, while his truck-driving father is on the road. Papa sends Miguel a turkey to fatten for Thanksgiving, but the boy names the bird Gracias and loves him as a pet. As the holiday approaches, Gracias' fate looms darkly over the festivities. However, when Gracias follows Miguel to church and receives Padre Jaime's blessing, even Abuelo and Abuela concede that they must have chicken for Thanksgiving, because "no one can eat a turkey that's been blessed." Cowley creates a distinctive, modern setting for the old theme of a turkey who sits <i>at</i> rather than <i>on</i> the Thanksgiving table. Although city life is not idealized (at one point a thief steals Gracias), most of the neighbors in Miguel's multiethnic community take a friendly interest in the boy and his bird. The inclusion of Spanish words within the text is handled well, with most meanings evident from the context, but a short glossary also appears on the last page. Cepeda's oil paintings, reminiscent of Ezra Jack Keats' illustrations, vividly create Miguel's colorful, sympathetic community as well as individual characters. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>The Sentence Is Death: A Novel (A Hawthorne and Horowitz Mystery)</h2><p><p>Death, deception, and a detective with quite a lot to hide stalk the pages of Anthony Horowitz&#x2019;s brilliant murder mystery, the second in the bestselling series starring Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne.<br><br><em>New York Times</em>&#x2013;bestselling author Anthony Horowitz and eccentric detective Daniel Hawthorne team up again in a new mystery, the sequel to the brilliantly inventive&nbsp;<em>The Word Is Murder</em>, to delve deep into the killing of a high-profile divorce lawyer and the death, only a day earlier, of his one-time friend.</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be here.

Born and raised in the rugged Appalachian foothills in southern West Virginia, he developed an affinity for hiking and exploring the woods, coves, and hollows of the hills. His family vacationed in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, deepening his love for this landscape with each visit.<br><br>Jason first encountered the Blue Ridge Parkway on a dark night, en route to the beach, when his family briefly followed this two-lane ribbon of highway across the Virginia mountains. Though the detour onto the Parkway lasted less than an hour, he knew he wanted to explore it further. In his 20s, he followed the Blue Ridge Parkway through Virginia, even continuing onto Skyline Drive for an <i>X-Files-</i>inspired road trip. When he moved to North Carolina, he discovered the beauty of the southern end of this drive. To this day, he takes the Blue Ridge Parkway any time he gets the chance.<br><br>Jason is the author of two Moon guidebooks<i>&#x2014;Moon North Carolina</i> and <i>Moon North Carolina Coast.</i> He also contributes to <i>Salt</i> magazine, AAA <i>Go!, Our State</i> and <i>Our State Eats</i> food blog, the Wilmington <i>StarNews&#x2014;</i>where he is a features contributor and dining critic&#x2014;the <i>Raleigh News and Observer,</i> the <i>Charlotte Observer,</i> the blog of Virgin Atlantic Airlines, and a number of other print and online publications.<br><br>From <i>Moon Blue Ridge Parkway Road Trip</i><br>The Blue Ridge Parkway is a 469-mile ridge-riding ribbon that runs from Great Smoky Mountains National Park to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.

I wish I had written it." </b></p><p>In 1947, Forbes magazine declared Lancaster, Ohio the epitome of the all-American town. Today it is damaged, discouraged, and fighting for its future. In <i>Glass House</i>, journalist Brian Alexander uses the story of one town to show how seeds sown 35 years ago have sprouted to give us Trumpism, inequality, and an eroding national cohesion.</p><p>The Anchor Hocking Glass Company, once the world&#x2019;s largest maker of glass tableware, was the base on which Lancaster&#x2019;s society was built. As <i>Glass House </i>unfolds, bankruptcy looms. With access to the company and its leaders, and Lancaster&#x2019;s citizens, Alexander shows how financial engineering took hold in the 1980s, accelerated in the 21st Century, and wrecked the company. We follow CEO Sam Solomon, an African-American leading the nearly all-white town&#x2019;s biggest private employer, as he tries to rescue the company from the New York private equity firm that hired him. Meanwhile, Alexander goes behind the scenes, entwined with the lives of residents as they wrestle with heroin, politics, high-interest lenders, low wage jobs, technology, and the new demands of American life: people like Brian Gossett, the fourth generation to work at Anchor Hocking; Joe Piccolo, first-time director of the annual music festival who discovers the town relies on him, and it, for salvation; Jason Roach, who police believed may have been Lancaster&#x2019;s biggest drug dealer; and Eric Brown, a local football hero-turned-cop who comes to realize that he can never arrest Lancaster&#x2019;s real problems.</p></p><p>Brian Alexander has written about American culture for decades. A former contributing editor to <i>Wired</i> magazine, he has been recognized by Medill School of Journalism's John Bartlow Martin awards for public interest journalism and other organizations. He grew up in Lancaster, with a family history in the glass business. He lives in California.<p>"There are some books that I think of as 'wake-up calls.'

Levine's series heroine Jaine Austen (<i>Death by Pantyhose</i>, etc.) spots a wealthy suburbanite's killer in the unfortunately skimpy The Danger of Candy Canes, where the subplot about a troubled teen is more compelling than the actual mystery. Hannah Swensen (<i>Key Lime Pie Murder</i>, etc.) experiments with new Christmas cookies (recipes included, of course) and gets to the bottom of a Santa slaying in Fluke's complex Candy Cane Murder, which includes several plausible suspects and a surprising twist-an impressive feat in just 150 pages. Meier's powerful Candy Canes of Christmas Past takes heroine Lucy Stone (<i>Bake Sale Murder</i>, etc.) back to December 1983, when, newly arrived in Tinker's Cove, Maine, she found herself investigating the circumstances of a decades-old local death and struggling with her own financial and domestic difficulties. Fluke and Meier ably make up for Levine's shortcomings to create a sweet holiday treat for mystery lovers. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They work side by side, fanning out beds of straw, bringing in the cows, and hooking up the milkers.</p><p>Soon they've filled milk can after milk can for the creamery truck that will arrive in the morning. The fresh dairy product isn't just for them&#x2014;other families will buy their milk, butter, and cheese at stores and farmers' markets near and far, connecting the little girl's farm to the world beyond.</p><p>Phyllis Alsdurf has created a poetic story that lovingly depicts the special bond between a child and her father, as well as the relationship between a young farmer and her animals. With Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher's exquisite illustrations, <i>It's Milking Time</i> is a must-have for any picture book collection.</p><p>A natural read-aloud selection for fans of Jane Yolen's <i>Owl Moon</i>.</p></p><p>PHYLLIS ALSDURF grew up on a southern Minnesota dairy farm, where one of her chores was to run down the lane and bring the cows to the barn for milking. In that herd of Holsteins was her father's favorite, Jay-Jay, the cow to whom this book is dedicated. Today Phyllis teaches writing at Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota. She lives in the Twin Cities with her husband, Jim, and two boxers, Stella and Sophie.<br><br>STEVE JOHNSON and LOU FANCHER have illustrated over thirty-five books for children, including<i> Jim Henson: The Guy Who Played with Puppets, A Boy Named FDR,</i> and <i>The Boy on Fairfield Street</i> by Kathleen Krull; <i>My Many Colored Days</i> by Dr. Seuss; and <i>New York's Bravest</i> by Mary Pope Osborne. <i>I Walk at Night</i> by Lois Duncan was a <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Children's Book of the Year. Steve and Lou live in California with their son, Nicholas. You can visit their website at johnsonandfancher.comAlsdurf grew up on a dairy farm in southern Minnesota and it shows. Every note of this gentle, yet never patronizing, story of how milk is retrieved from cows is authentic, and it&#x2019;s exactly these specifics that will be eye-opening to young readers: how the stanchions are lowered to keep the cows in place, how the teats are washed, how the milkers are attached with leather straps, and so forth. The story follows a little girl helping her father with the daily milking chores, a task of comforting repetition. Throughout, she repeats the same phrase: &#x201c;Every morning, every night, it&#x2019;s milking time.&#x201d; Just as fine as the detailed descriptions is Alsdurf&#x2019;s way of conjuring the slow, quiet texture of farm life: &#x201c;The air is hot, heavy. Overhead a fan whirs. Tails swishing, the cows chomp and chew their cud.&#x201d; Johnson and Fancher&#x2019;s dusty watercolors lend the grit of a family farm a halcyon hue and match Alsdurf&#x2019;s realism at every step. A nicely understated glimpse at a life fewer and fewer kids are likely to see.

Sayers, &#x201c;one of the greatest mystery story writers of the [twentieth] century&#x201d; (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>), the first mystery featuring Lord Peter Wimsey.</strong></p><p>A corpse has been found in the bath of an architect's flat, wearing nothing but a pair of pince-nez. A financier has seemingly vanished into thin air from his bedroom.</p><p>The ever-curious Lord Peter Wimsey is intrigued by these odd events. Ignoring the clumsy efforts of the official investigator looking into the death, the aristocratic amateur sleuth, accompanied by his valet, Bunter, a skilled photographer, begins his own inquiry. The gentleman detective soon becomes convinced that the two cases are somehow linked. Now, he must uncover the connection&#x2014;and the investigation quickly begins to bleed into his own life, stirring up dark memories of World War I that will have unexpected consequences for Wimsey and the faithful Bunter.</p></p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers, long considered one of the top mystery authors of our day, has excelled herself in this delightfully macabre tale which centers around the disappearance of a wealthy financier and the discovery of a nude corpse, wearing a golden pince-nez, in a bathtub. Sayer's most renowned amateur detective, the engaging and amusing Lord Peter Wimsey, sets out to unravel this puzzling case under the jealous eye of Scotland Yard. Needless to say he succeeds in solving things to everyone's ultimate satisfaction, but only after a series of bloodcurdling and hair-raising episodes that will hold you spellbound with anticipation.<p>Here is a truly rare find for anyone who is interested in top-flight crime fiction. The New York Times said of this book ""the tale is better written, and has a good deal more characterization than one finds in the average detective story"".</p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers was born in 1893. She was one of the first women to be awarded a degree by Oxford University, and later she became a copywriter at an ad agency. In 1923 she published her first novel featuring the aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who became one of the world's most popular fictional heroes. She died in 1957.</p></p><h2>Nights in Rodanthe</h2><p><b>Struggling to care for her sick father and raise her teenage children alone, a divorced mother spends the weekend at a North Carolina inn, only to meet a former surgeon running from his past.</b><br>Adrienne Willis is 45 and has been divorced for three years, abandoned by her husband for a younger woman. The trials of raising her teenage children and caring for her sick father have worn her down, but at the request of a friend and in hopes of respite, she's gone to the coastal village of Rodanthe in North Carolina to tend the local inn for the weekend. With a major storm brewing, the time away doesn't look promising...until a guest named Paul Flanner arrives. <br>At 54, Paul is a successful surgeon, but in the previous six months his life has unraveled into something he doesn't recognize. Estranged from his son and recently divorced, he's sold his practice and his home and has journeyed to this isolated town in hopes of closing a painful chapter in his past. Adrienne and Paul come together as the storm brews over Rodanthe, but what begins between them over the weekend will resonate throughout the rest of their lives, intertwining past and future, love and loss.<br> <br></p><p>With over 100 million copies of his books sold, Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's most beloved storytellers. His novels include fifteen #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, and all of his books, including <i>Three Weeks with My Brother</i>, the memoir he wrote with his brother, Micah, have been <i>New York Times</i> and international bestsellers, and were translated into more than fifty languages. Eleven of Nicholas Sparks's novels--<i>The Choice, The Longest Ride, The Best of Me, Safe Haven, The Lucky One, The Last Song, Dear John, Nights in Rodanthe, The Notebook, A Walk to Remember</i>, and <i>Message in a Bottle</i>--have been adapted into major motion pictures.Adrienne Willis's concern for her widowed daughter prompts her to relate a story she thought would live only in her own heart, a story of love and redemption, loss and grief. JoBeth Williams's tender narration captures the introspection and sadness of Adrienne's tale, as well as its passion. Her detached portrayal of Paul and Adrienne's lives before they find each other conveys all the flatness of their existence, despite the many events filling their days. Williams's characterizations, however, particularly that of the women, would be better if they were not infused with Southern accents. While technically accurate, they sound more stereotypical than real. Soft piano interludes elegantly separate chapters and polish the finished work.

The time has come to claim Britain for the Empire. Centurions Cato and Macro are preparing for what their leaders say will be the final battle against those natives refusing to accept the civilising force of Rome. The British savages will surely stand no chance against the might of the unstoppable Roman army.</p><p>But young Cato is more concerned about hot-headed cohort commander, Maximius, than about the enemy, and with Roman troops being brutally slaughtered, even grizzled veteran Macro is having doubts about the promised ease of their success. Will they be victorious - or will the battle cost both of them more than they could ever imagine?</p></p><p>"Perfect for Cornwell addicts who will relish its historical detail and fast-paced action.

The troop'' commander, General Plautius, is under considerable pressure from the emperor to crush the natives once and for all. Centurions Macro and Cato are with the crack Second Legion under the precarious leadership of Centurion Maximus, and it's their task to hold a ford across the river Tamesis when the natives are forced into a trap. <br>But Maximus's nerve breaks at the critical point, allowing the enemy leader and his men to escape. Outraged by this failure, General Plautius orders the decimation of Macro and Cato's unit. Their choice: die, or escape to become fugitives pursued by soldiers of their own ruthless army. Hiding from their former comrades, as well as the Britons, Cato's small band of fugitives has only one chance to redeem itself before its soldiers are hunted down, like animals. <br>British Praise for "The Eagle's Prey": <br>"Scarrow's legionary adventures have put guts back into historical writing.

In the words of David Remnick, author of Lenin&#39;s Tomb, &#34;(this book is) like watching an endless parade of the great characters of American life . . . as rich as a great novel.&#34;A 30-year treasury of columns, essays, reviews, and reports from Pulitzer Prize-winner Kempton, a New York Newsday columnist and New York Review of Books contributor who richly deserves wide notice. In pieces from the above-mentioned publications as well as Harper's, Esquire, and the pre-Murdoch New York Post, among others, Kempton presents an archive of observed history. His inimitable, almost classical, style, grounded in humanism, is elegantly precise, dispatching subjects in a phrase. He calls Elia Kazan's apologies before McCarthy's witch hunt ``an acceptance of humiliation for the sake of survival in a confiscatory tax bracket.'' On lost 1960s radical Jane Alpert: ``She did not so much rise to the challenge of her time as yield to infection by its vagrant air.'' On El Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's views: ``about as far from the center as a statesman can get without reinvoking the Fugitive Slave Act.'' Kempton knows history, and tragedy, and literature, finding Joseph Conrad his best guide to Central America and Anton Chekhov his cicerone to the Soviets. He brings us Paul Robeson, Martin Luther King Jr., and Huey Newton; Machiavelli, the Mafia, and Michael Milken; Roy Cohn, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon. His columns from New York present Gotham's indignities and ironies: public indifference to gay- bashing; the demise of a junkie ``incautious with gossip''; an auction of Marilyn Monroe's memorabilia. For anyone interested in journalism, politics, and history, or in the observations of a clear and skeptical eye, nearly every piece has its delights. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her husband, Gilbert Joseph, returns from the war expecting to be received as a hero, but finds his status as a black man in Britain to be second class. His white landlady, Queenie, raised as a farmer's daughter, befriends Gilbert, and later Hortense, with innocence and courage, until the unexpected arrival of her husband, Bernard, who returns from combat with issues of his own to resolve. <br><br>Told in these four voices, <i>Small Island </i>is a courageous novel of tender emotion and sparkling wit, of crossings taken and passages lost, of shattering compassion and of reckless optimism in the face of insurmountable barriers---in short, an encapsulation of that most American of experiences: the immigrant's life.<br><br></p><p>Andrea Levy's award-winning novel, <i>Small Island</i>, deftly brings two bleak families into crisp focus. First a Jamaican family, including the well-intentioned Gilbert, who can never manage to say or do exactly the right thing; Romeo Michael, who leaves a wake of women in his path; and finally, Hortense, whose primness belies her huge ambition to become English in every way possible. The other unhappy family is English, starting with Queenie, who escapes the drudgery of being a butcher's daughter only to marry a dull banker. As the chapters reverse chronology and the two groups collide and finally mesh, the book unfolds through time like a photo album, and Levy captures the struggle between class, race, and sex with a humor and tenderness that is both authentic and bracing. The book is cinematic in the best way--lighting up London's bombed-out houses and wartime existence with clarity and verve while never losing her character's voice or story. <i>--Meg Halverson</i><br>Born in 1956 to Jamaican parents, Andrea Levy is the author of three previous novels and has received a British Arts Council Writers Award in addition to the Orange Prize and Whitbread distinctions.

This is true of many cultures, but in Hawaii, no one seems to have left. And in Hawaii, a set of myths accompanied each of these migrants&#x2015;legends that shape our understanding of this mysterious place.<br> In <i>Paradise of the Pacific</i>, Susanna Moore, the award-winning author of <i>In the Cut</i> and <i>The Life of Objects</i>, pieces together the elusive, dramatic story of late-eighteenth-century Hawaii&#x2015;its kings and queens, gods and goddesses, missionaries, migrants, and explorers&#x2015;a not-so-distant time of abrupt transition, in which an isolated pagan world of human sacrifice and strict taboo, without a currency or a written language, was confronted with the equally ritualized world of capitalism, Western education, and Christian values.</p></p><p><p><b>Susanna Moore</b> is the author of the novels <i>The Life of Objects</i>, <i>The Big Girls</i>, <i>One Last Look</i>, <i>In the Cut</i>, <i>Sleeping Beauties</i>, <i>The Whiteness of Bones</i>, and <i>My Old Sweetheart</i>, and two books of nonfiction, <i>Light Years: A Girlhood in Hawai'i </i>and <i>I Myself Have Seen It: The Myth of Hawai'i</i>. She is from Hawaii.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Paradise of the Pacific</i>, Ms. Moore&#x2019;s new nonfiction book about Hawaii . . . provides a fascinating history of that Pacific archipelago . . . It is an elegantly written and conscientiously researched book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></p><br><p>&#x201c;[<i>Paradise of the Pacific</i> is] an astonishingly learned summation of the Hawaiian meaning, elegantly written, often delightfully entertaining and ultimately sad.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jan Morris, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] fascinating account . . . The power of <i>Paradise of the Pacific</i>, then&#x2015;as well as its bitter beauty&#x2015;resides in Moore's ability to lay out this progression as a set of turning points, inevitable from the standpoint of the present, but in their own time more a matter of human ambition and fallibility.&#x201d; &#x2015;David Ulin, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c; <i>Paradise of the Pacific</i>, a superb telling of the Hawaiian story from the earliest voyages, is immensely satisfying on so many levels-as a detailed history, as a startling drama, as a cultural heritage of bellicosity and beauty. Susanna Moore, a brilliant novelist, a scrupulous researcher, gives this complex history an astonishing vitality.&#x201d; &#x2015;Paul Theroux</p><p>&#x201c;Just when I think I know all there is to know about Hawaiian history, Susanna Moore (once again) proves me wrong. With a voice of friendly authority and wit, she translates meticulous research into gripping prose.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kaui Hemmings, <i>author of The Descendants</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a fascinating and well-balanced look at how a unique culture came to be and the heartbreaking manner of its end.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Moore digs deep and delivers a thoroughly researched account of Hawaii's distinct culture and history . . . Moore's background in storytelling radiates throughout this work, creating a quick-paced and well-crafted narrative. Highly recommended for the armchair historian and those intrigued by Hawaiian history, maritime exploration, and the history of Christian missionaries.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Paradise of the Pacific</i> is a work of scholarship, sympathy, and, as with all Susanna Moore's books, literary elegance. It is also a long amazement.

The objects he has found are made by everyday people inspired to create something themselves, rather than buying manufactured goods. Many have been made in pursuit of a hobby, or because the maker had the time and inclination to construct something personal. In other cases, the objects are more vital to the maker&#x2019;s livelihood. Arkhipov&#x2019;s archive includes hundreds of objects created with idiosyncratic functional qualities: an Austrian ski-bob made using an old bicycle frame; a metal strip full of spikes used to deter pigeons from landing on window ledges; a beautifully painted rocking-motorbike for children; and a device from Germany that enables a musician to play three brass tubas at once. This volume features 230 individual artifacts from Albania, Austria, Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and Wales, each of which is accompanied by a photograph of the creator, their story of how the object came about, its function and the materials used to create it. With a foreword by Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller, <i>Home-Made Europe</i> is an essential companion to the first volume, expanding its theme with more recent objects that suggest that the charm of the home-made utilitarian object transcends even the dictates of necessity.</p><p>Across 256 pages, this small but enlightening anthology brings together such DIY "products" as an outdoor shower assembled from school bus doors; and a makeshift table topped with a street sign, which looks as if it belongs in a hipster loft. (David Dick-Agnew <i>Azure</i>)<br><br>The objects we buy are supposed to tell us something about who we are. But they don't tell us half as much as the objects we make, as even a quick flick through Home-Made Europe: Contemporary Folk Artifacts reveals. Here are everyday things people have fashioned with their own hands. Heaters, hammers, anchors, rat-traps, barbecues, showers and goalposts. They range from the pitiful &#x2013; a child's grill for corn on the cob, rigged out of wires bent over tea lights &#x2013; to the technically impressive &#x2013; one man made a fridge. This is a catalogue of human resourcefulness. (Justin McGuirk <i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>Home-made Europe, by Vladimir Arkhipov, is a humble tribute to home-spun DIY. The Russian artist criss-crossed Europe to find ordinary people who have addressed their household needs with extraordinary inventions, often involving bits of other household objects.

In <b>In A Sunburned Country</b>, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world&#x2019;s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> reports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably. Though <i>A Short History</i> clocks in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of <i>Life</i> and <i>Trilobite</i>) and these interviews are charming. But it's when Bryson dives into some of science's best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway Morris vs. Gould--that he finds literary gold. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>&#x201c;Stylish [and] stunningly accurate prose.

It cuts through the fields and the woods, drops down into a valley, then winds across the valley floor till it ends at a well. The villagers know this well. They call it &#x201c;Despair.&#x201d; </p><p>It&#x2019;s an old, old well&#x2014;older than any remember; and cold because the shaft goes deep, deep into the earth; and still. Its stones are green, all covered with moss. Lizards slip between the cracks. Lizards peep out with leatherlike stares and vanish when the wind grows sharp&#x2014;for the wind grows sharp indeed. It screams down the length of the valley, and Hoooo! it blows on the hole of the well. Hoooo! Hoooo!&#x2014;which to the villager&#x2019;s ears sounds like, You! You! I&#x2019;ll swallow you! I&#x2019;ll drink you like water and eat you like foooood! </p><p>Nobody comes to the well. Or nobody nearly. The women who wash with water don&#x2019;t come, nor the men who drink cool water in the heat of the day, nor the children who play. Not even the dogs of the village will creep by the Well Despair, because they know. Everyone knows. For seven generations they&#x2019;ve whispered the stories by firelight, shuddering, shivering, grave; and they know that deep in that well there dwells a Troll. </p><p>Ah, there it is. Now we have spoken it: the Troll! It&#x2019;s the Troll that parents use to scare their children indoors at night: &#x201c;Come! Come! Or the Troll will get you. He&#x2019;ll drink you like water! He&#x2019;ll eat you like food!&#x201d; </p><p>It&#x2019;s the Troll that causes the children to whimper while they are sleeping, dreaming, dreaming. </p><p>It&#x2019;s because of the Troll that grandparents and great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents named the well &#x201c;Despair.&#x201d; </p><p>And every time his story is told, the Troll grows greener and grimmer and uglier. </p><p>Yes, the Troll. But what shall we say of him? What is the truth and not a story? </p><p>Well, he isn&#x2019;t a mole, because he&#x2019;s too much like a man. He frowns like a man. But he can&#x2019;t be a man exactly either, because he digs in the darkness and shrinks from the light. Light hurts him as bad as fire can; but his hearing is as good as miracles. His arms are long and powerful. He has claws on his fingers and fangs in his mouth and green in his eyes, which glow; his green eyes glow in the dark. He leaps as lightly as a cat from ledge to ledge inside his well. His fur is thick; his back is bunched; his whiskers are wet&#x2014;and always his brow is frowning because always he&#x2019;s trying to think, and thinking is hard for the Troll, who isn&#x2019;t a man exactly. </p><p>Nobody comes to the well. Or nobody nearly. . . . </p><p>One day, suddenly, a small girl does appear in the terrible circle of daylight at the top of the well. She&#x2019;s shaking her head. She&#x2019;s sobbing: &#x201c;Ow-ooo! Ow-ooooo!&#x201d; </p><p>The Troll cannot look up without burning his eyes; but he listens, for the child is wailing like the wind, but she&#x2019;s younger and sadder than the wind, and the Troll hears the difference. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Mama!&#x201d; she wails. Like rain her tears spill down upon the Troll, but they are warmer than the rain; they sting like sorrow, and the Troll can feel the difference. </p><p>&#x201c;Mama, why did you have to die?&#x201d; </p><p>To die? The Troll covers his mouth and makes no sound. </p><p>&#x201c;You lied to me,&#x201d; the child cries. &#x201c;You said you loved me&#x2014;but how can you love me and go away too?&#x201d; The Troll hears little fists hitting the stones above. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t love Elisabeth. You died. You left me. Mama, Mama, you lied to me!&#x201d; </p><p>Now the Troll hears the whip and crackle of the little girl&#x2019;s hair as she yanks something from it. Two somethings. &#x201c;What do I want with your things?&#x201d; she cries. &#x201c;Papa wants me to wear your combs. Papa wants me to be glad again. But I don&#x2019;t want to be glad. And I don&#x2019;t want your combs. No! No!&#x201d; </p><p>Something lands on the Troll&#x2019;s head. Two somethings&#x2014;and they catch in his hair. He reaches and pulls out two tortoiseshell combs, in which he can smell love&#x2014;the love of a mother, the love of a father&#x2014;and the grief of a little girl, who is sobbing against the stones above, murmuring, &#x201c;Gone, gone, gone, gone. No, I won&#x2019;t trust anyone, since everyone lies, lies, lies.&#x201d;<br>So speaks Elisabeth. </p><p>And now the Troll is frowning dreadfully. With green-glowing eyes, he&#x2019;s staring at two combs in his claws, and his heart is beating sorrow for the child above, and his nose&#x2014;yes, and all his breathing&#x2014;is filled with the love of the combs, and his forehead is frowning because he is trying to think one good and helpful thought.</p></p><h2>The Hiding Place (The Christian Library)</h2><p>� I pray that God forgive them...� <br><br>Corrie Ten Boom stood naked with her older sister Betsie, watching a concentration camp matron beating a prisoner. � Oh, the poor woman,� Corrie cried. � Yes.

Today's music owes much to her innovation and inspiration. This complete collection of her poetry and song lyrics reads like a poem cycle that finds unexpected meaning and beauty on the page.<br><br>After displaying a haunting and sophisticated quality in her first albums, Joni Mitchell (1968), Clouds (1969), Ladies of the Canyon (1970), and Blue (1972), Mitchell reached her poetic apotheosis in the surreal and mythical Hejira (1976) and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter (1977). During the '80s, Mitchell used her words to explore and mirror the commercial energy of the decade. She became more reflective in the following years with Night Ride Home (1991) and Turbulent Indigo (1994). Mitchell continues to grow her already remarkable talent, as is evident with her latest work, Taming the Tiger (1998).<br><br>The importance of Mitchell's entire oeuvre is unequivocal when seen as a lifetime of accomplished writing. As epic poet and tragedian, the power and honesty of her voice has inspired generations past and those to come. Joni Mitchell: The Complete Poems and Lyrics gives us the first opportunity to reconsider Mitchell's written work and her exalted place among the great poets and lyricists of our time.<br><br>This paperback edition includes the lyrics to Joni Mitchell's new album, Taming the Tiger, as well as an index for easy access to all titles.</p><p>The sweeping imagery and confessional tone of Joni Mitchell&#39;s lyrics have made her a pop icon for decades. Her writing, like that of Paul Simon and Bob Dylan, helped legitimize song lyrics as poetry by adding sophisticated shadings and nuances that earlier rock and folk music often lacked. What&#39;s more, as a woman writing in a medium dominated by men, Mitchell became an important role model for young women trying to make sense of their lives during turbulent times. Given her importance as a pop poet and the care and craft with which she approached her craft, it is a treat now to have her work compiled in one volume. Mitchell&#39;s has been an aural art, but having the words to read on the page without benefit of melody heightens one&#39;s appreciation of the lyrics as poems.Joni Mitchell has recorded twenty albums and is the winner of two Grammy Awards. She is also the recipient of, among many others, Canada's Governor General's Performing Arts Award and Billboard magazine's "Century Award." Ms. Mitchell was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in May 1997.</p><h2>When the Sun Rose (Sandcastle Books)</h2><p>&#34;Another luminous picture book . . . worthy of attention for its serenely bright, well-designed paintings, celebrating friendship and sunlight.&#34;--Kirkus Reviews. &#34;A picture book dreamscape, full of radiant colors and intriguing possibilities . . . an inspired work of art.&#34;--Publishers Weekly. Full color throughout.</p><p>Barbara Helen Berger lives on Bainbridge Island, Washington.Kindergarten-Grade 3 While the action can be described in only one sentence (a friend visits a little girl for an afternoon of tea, playing dolls, and painting rainbows), many lines are needed to convey the activity in these boldly-colored illustrations. The warm glow of the yellows of a carriage made from a rose, the lion pulling it, and a dress made from yellow roses achieves luminescence on paper, heightened by the intense greens, reds, and blues of the countryside and playhouse. The yellow changes to rich gold as the sun sets. The variation in picture size, from small close-ups of the dolls to elongated spreads, adds flow to the day's happening and lends a cinematic quality. The combination of vibrant colors, strong composition, and margin motif together frame a sensation, like a daydream visualized. That the friend may be imagined only adds to the book's appeal. As with Berger's previous books, Grandfather Twilight (1984) and Donkey's Dream (1985, both Philomel) , this picture book provides a vivid showcase for a simple story.

His new home. And more, for as the new marshal, he'd be responsible for protecting the town and its residents.<br><br>Not that he could see much of it just then, with all that steam from the smokestack billowing between the train and the depot.<br><br>The view didn't particularly matter to him, anyhow, since he'd paid a brief visit to the town a few months back and seen what there was to see&#x2014;which hadn't been much, even in the sun-spangled, blue-sky days of summer. Now that winter was coming on&#x2014;Clay's granddad, Angus, claimed it snowed dust and chiggers in that part of Texas&#x2014;the rutted roads and weathered facades of the ramshackle buildings would no doubt be of bleak appearance.<br><br>With an inward sigh, Clay stood to retrieve his black, round-brimmed hat and worn duster from the wooden rack overhead. In the process, he allowed himself to ponder, yet again, all he'd left behind to come to this place at the hind end of beyond and carve out a life of his own making.<br><br>He'd left plenty.<br><br>A woman, to start with. And then there was his family, the sprawling McKettrick clan, including his ma and pa, Chloe and Jeb, his two older sisters and the thriving Triple M Ranch, with its plentitude of space and water and good grass.<br><br>A fragment of a Bible verse strayed across his brain. <em>The cattle on a thousand hills...</em><br><br>There were considerably fewer than a thousand hills on the Triple M, big as it was, but the cattle were legion.<br><br>To his granddad's way of thinking, those hills and the land they anchored might have been on loan from the<br><br>Almighty, but everything else&#x2014;cows, cousins, mineral deposits and timber included&#x2014;belonged to Angus Mc-Kettrick, his four sons and his daughter, Katie.<br><br>Clay shrugged into the long coat and put on his hat. His holster and pistol were stowed in his trunk in the baggage compartment, and his paint gelding, Outlaw, rode all alone in the car reserved for livestock.<br><br>The only other passenger on board, an angular woman with severe features and no noticeable inclination toward small talk, remained seated, with the biggest Bible Clay had ever seen resting open on her lap. She seemed poised to leap right into the pages at the first hint of sin and disappear into all those apocalyptic threats and grand promises. According to the conductor, a fitful little fellow bearing the pitted scars of a long-ago case of smallpox, the lady had come all the way from Cincinnati with the express purpose of saving the heathen.<br><br>Clay&#x2014;bone-tired, homesick for the ranch and for his kinfolks, and wryly amused, all of a piece&#x2014;nodded a respectful farewell to the woman as he passed her seat, resisting the temptation to stop and inquire about the apparent shortage of heathens in Cincinnati.<br><br>Most likely, he decided, reaching the door, she'd already converted the bunch of them, and now she was out to wrestle the devil for the whole state of Texas. He wouldn't have given two cents for old Scratch's chances.<br><br>A chill wind, laced with tiny flakes of snow, buffeted Clay as he stepped down onto the small platform, where all three members of the town council, each one stuffed into his Sunday best and half-strangled by a celluloid collar, waited to greet the new marshal.<br><br>Mayor Wilson Ponder spoke for the group. "Welcome to Blue River, Mr. McKettrick," the fat man boomed, a blustery old cuss with white muttonchop whiskers and piano-key teeth that seemed to operate independently of his gums.<br><br>Clay, still in his late twenties and among the youngest of the McKettrick cousins, wasn't accustomed to being addressed as "mister"&#x2014;around home, he answered to "hey, you"&#x2014;and he sort of liked the novelty of it. "Call me Clay," he said.<br><br>There were handshakes all around.<br><br>The conductor lugged Clay's trunk out of the baggage car and plunked it down on the platform, then busily consulted his pocket watch.<br><br>"Better unload that horse of yours," he told Clay, in the officious tone so often adopted by short men who didn't weigh a hundred pounds sopping wet, "if you don't want him going right on to Fort Worth. This train pulls out in five minutes."<br><br>Clay nodded, figuring Outlaw would be ready by now for fresh air and a chance to stretch his legs, since he'd been cooped up in a rolling box ever since Flagstaff.<br><br>Taking his leave from the welcoming committee with a touch to the brim of his hat and a promise to meet them later at the marshal's office, he crossed the small platform, descended the rough-hewn steps and walked through cinders and lingering wisps of steam to the open door of the livestock car. He lowered the heavy ramp himself and climbed into the dim, horse-scented enclosure.<br><br>Outlaw nickered a greeting, and Clay smiled and patted the horse's long neck before picking up his saddle and other gear and tossing the lot of it to the ground beside the tracks.<br><br>That done, he loosed the knot in Outlaw's halter rope and led the animal toward the ramp.<br><br>Some horses balked at the unfamiliar, but not Outlaw. He and Clay had been sidekicks for more than a decade, and they trusted each other in all circumstances.<br><br>Outside, in the brisk, snow-dappled wind, having traversed the slanted iron plate with no difficulty, Outlaw blinked, adjusting his unusual blue eyes to the light of midafternoon. Clay meant to let the gelding stand un-tethered while he put the ramp back in place, but before he could turn around, a little girl hurried around the corner of the brick depot and took a competent hold on the lead rope.<br><br>She couldn't have been older than seven, and she was small even for that tender age. She wore a threadbare calico dress, a brown bonnet and a coat that, although clean, had seen many a better day. A blond sausage curl tumbled from inside the bonnet to gleam against her forehead, and she smiled with the confidence of a seasoned wrangler.<br><br>"My name is Miss Edrina Nolan," she announced importantly. "Are you the new marshal?"<br><br>Amused, Clay tugged at his hat brim to acknowledge her properly and replied, "I am. Name's Clay McKettrick."<br><br>Edrina put out her free hand. "How do you do, Mr. McKettrick?" she asked.<br><br>"I do just fine," he said, with a little smile. Growing up on the Triple M, he and all his cousins had been around horses all their lives, so the child's remarkable ease with a critter many times her size did not surprise him.<br><br>It was impressive, though.<br><br>"I'll hold your horse," she said. "You'd better help the railroad man with that ramp. He's liable to hurt himself if you don't."<br><br>Clay looked back over one shoulder and, sure enough, there was the banty rooster of a conductor, struggling to hoist that heavy slab of rust-speckled iron off the ground so the train could get under way again. He lent his assistance, figuring he'd just spared the man a hernia, if not a heart attack, and got a glare for his trouble, rather than thanks.<br><br>Since the fellow's opinion made no real never-mind to Clay either way, he simply turned back to the little girl, ready to reclaim his horse.<br><br>She was up on the horse's back, her faded skirts billowing around her, and with the snow-strained sunlight framing her, she looked like one of those cherub-children gracing the pages of calendars, Valentines and boxes of ready-made cookies.<br><br>"Whoa, now," he said, automatically taking hold of the lead rope. Given that he hadn't saddled Outlaw yet, he was somewhat mystified as to how she'd managed to mount up the way she had. Maybe she really was a cherub, with little stubby wings hidden under that thin black coat.<br><br>Up ahead, the engineer blew the whistle to signal imminent departure, and Outlaw started at the sound, though he didn't buck, thank the good Lord.<br><br>"Whoa," Clay repeated, very calmly but with a note of sternness. It was then that he spotted the stump on the other side of the horse and realized that Edrina must have scrambled up on that to reach Outlaw's back.<br><br>They all waited&#x2014;man, horse and cherub&#x2014;until the train pulled out and the racket subsided somewhat.<br><br>Edrina smiled serenely down at him. "Mama says we'll all have to go to the poorhouse, now that you're here," she announced.<br><br>"Is that so?" Clay asked mildly, as he reached up, took the child by the waist and lifted her off the horse, setting her gently on her feet. Then he commenced to collecting Outlaw's blanket, saddle and bridle from where they'd landed when he tossed them out of the railroad car, and tacking up. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the town-council contingent straggling off the platform.<br><br>Edrina nodded in reply to his rhetorical question, still smiling, and the curl resting on her forehead bobbed with the motion of her head. "My papa was the marshal a while back," she informed Clay matter-of-factly, "but then he died in the arms of a misguided woman in a room above the Bitter Gulch Saloon and left us high and dry."<br><br>Clay blinked, wondering if he'd mistaken Edrina Nolan for a child when she was actually a lot older. Say, forty.<br><br>"I see," he said, after clearing his throat. "That's unfortunate. That your papa passed on, I mean." Clay had known the details of his predecessor's death, having been regaled with the story the first time he set foot in Blue River, but it took him aback that Edrina knew it, too.<br><br>She folded her arms and watched critically as he threw on Outlaw's beat-up saddle and put the cinch through the buckle. "Can you shoot a gun and everything?" she wanted to know.<br><br>Clay spared her a sidelong glance and a nod. Why wasn't this child in school? Did her mother know she was running loose like a wild Indian and leaping onto the backs of other people's horses when they weren't looking?<br><br>And where the heck had a kid her age learned to ride like that?<br><br>"Good," Edrina said, with a relieved sigh, her little arms still folded. "Because Papa couldn't be trusted with a firearm. Once, when he was cleaning a pistol, meaning to go out and hunt rabbits for stew, it went off by accident and made a big hole in the floor. Mama put a chair over it&#x2014;she said it was so my sister, Harriet, and I wouldn't fall in and wind up under the house, with all the cobwebs and the mice, but I know it was really because she was embarrassed for anybody to see what Papa had done. Even Harriet has more sense than to fall in a hole, for heaven's sake, and she's only five."<br><br>Clay suppressed a smile, tugged at the saddle to make sure it would hold his weight, put a foot into the stirrup and swung up. Adjusted his hat in a gesture of farewell. "I'll be seeing you, chatterbox," he said kindly.<br><br>"What about your trunk?" Edrina wanted to know. "Are you just going to leave it behind, on the platform?"<br><br>"I mean to come back for it later in the day," Clay explained, wondering why he felt compelled to clarify the matter at all. "This horse and I, we've been on that train for a goodly while, and right now, we need to stretch our muscles a bit."<br><br>"I could show you where our house is," Edrina persisted, scampering along beside Outlaw when Clay urged the horse into a walk. "Well, I guess it's <em>your</em> house now."<br><br>"Maybe you ought to run along home," Clay said. "Your mama's probably worried about you."<br><br>"No," Edrina said. "Mama has no call to worry. She thinks I'm in school."<br><br>Clay bit back another grin.<br><br></p><h2>Ruin Beach</h2><p>The second instalment in a&nbsp;gripping and atmospheric crime series set on a small island where there is no escape . . . &#x2018;Gripping, clever and impossible to put down' ERIN KELLYTHE ISLAND OF TRESCO HOLDS A DARK SECRET SOMEONE WILL KILL TO PROTECT.Ben Kitto is the Scilly Isles' Deputy Chief of Police, but as the island's lazy summer takes hold, he finds himself missing the excitement of the murder squad in London - until the body of a diver is discovered, anchored to the rocks of a nearby cave.

But far more interesting than her fallow state (if we may be permitted such a word to refer to her appearance as provided by nature) is her cultivated state, or the woman as she presented herself to those who guarded the Imperial Wing.She was dressed in the yellow, green, and brown of her House, but the yellow was the pure, bright color of those flowers that grow in the lower valleys of Tursk, and took the form of a silk blouse embroidered with russet needlework of an exceptionally fine character. Her leather riding pants were also russet, and flared widely around her boots, which were dyed the bright green of new grass and had wide extensions in the form of wings emerging from the heels. She wore, as well, a woolen cloak of a tan color, with a clasp in the form of a dzur, wrought with fine silver wire.These details now having been placed before the reader, let us make haste to follow her progress, which has not halted for our indulgences; while we have been describing her dress, the Teckla, whose name is Seb, after stating hermission, has been granted admission into the presence of His Majesty the Emperor, and we can, therefore, follow her and hear the delivery of this message ourselves.Because, being a Teckla, she could not be given a safe-conduct badge, Seb was escorted by one of the guardsmen on duty, a certain Dragonlord called Tummelis e'Terics, who brought her to the officer on duty, who looked the Teckla over briefly but thoroughly before signifying, with an almost imperceptible nod of his head, that she could pass. This was all taking place, be it well understood, in the First Antechamber (or the Last Antechamber, as some have it, but we will hold to the usage of the historians of the period of which we write, and hope that our readers' perspicacity will surmount any confusion this causes), which connected to the First Lower Level Imperial Audience Chamber, to give its official title, or the Throne Room, as some historians have it, or the Portrait Room, as it was actually called.At the point at which we begin our history, it has just passed the quarter-hour after the third hour after noon, and the Portrait Room doors are, consequently, standing wide open. Seb, notwithstanding her House, walked with full confidence among the nobles and courtiers who milled about the room, who in fact filled the room to the point of straining to the utmost the ingenious cooling spells that the Athyra Marchioness of Blackpool had set upon it.At length, upon reaching a point directly before His Majesty, where waited Brudik, Lord of the Chimes, Tummelis, her mission accomplished, gave the messenger into Lord Brudik's care. This worthy, who had held his post for some fifteen hundred years, turned to His Majesty and announced, in his droning voice, "A messenger from Her Highness Sennya, Duchess of Blackbirdriver, and Dzur Heir."His Majesty was just then amusing himself in a customary way, between bantering conversations with various courtiers: He was attempting to make himself angry, then sad, then happy, in order to make the Orb, which rotated above his head, change color. He was, as usual, achieving only indifferent success, wherefore the Orb glowed with the pale red of annoyance, which changed instantly to a delicate green as, at the Lord Brudik's announcement, he looked up with an expression of mild interest."Ah," he said. "From Sennya.""That is it, Your Majesty," said Brudik."Well," said His Majesty, trying to remember if he had ever heard the name Sennya, and, if so, in what context, "then, let the messenger come before me."As the worthy Seb steps up to address the Emperor Tortaalik, we willpermit ourselves to quickly sketch the changes that have occurred in the outer, and, to some extent, the inner character of His Majesty since we last had occasion to bring him to the attention of our readers, which was at the beginning of his reign, in the history of <i>The Phoenix Guards</i>.The Emperor, we should note, had changed but little in appearance. He had begun to paint his fingernails, forehead, and ears (all of which on this occasion were a bright red that set off the gold of his costume), and he now wore diamonds on all occasions, in the form of rings, bracelets, earrings, headdress, and necklaces; but neither his face nor his physique had undergone any transformation excepting only the addition of a few lines in the former and a bit of settling in the latter. Our readers will remember his delicate skin, of which he took greater care than ever, bathing every day in scented oils; his pale blue, narrow eyes; and his fine, yellow hair, which was of medium length and curled inward below his ears.As for those aspects of his character which are not readily visible, we may say, with the perspective that only distance brings, that the fundamental shift in his personality had begun some four hundred years earlier, when he was forced to exile his sister for taking part in an attempt to introduce poisons into his drink through certain specially prepared goblets which were impenetrable to the mysterious powers of the Orb, although not, as it turned out, to the more mundane abilities of Gyorg Lavode. In point of fact, it is certainly the case that Tortaalik's sister had been the chief mover behind the entire affair, which information His Majesty did his best to suppress, although whether out of affection for his sister, a desire to limit the scandal, or for other reasons entirely, we will not speculate. But he had certainly changed since then, becoming gradually, over the course of the next few centuries, at once whimsical and morose, devoting much effort to idle amusements, and much time to doing nothing whatsoever, this pursuit being occasionally interrupted by sudden and short-lived periods of intense interest in the doings of the State of which he stood at the prow.Of the many changes in the makeup of the court, the two most significant were the retirement of His Discretion, the Duke of Wellborn, and the appointment of Jurabin to the position of Prime Minister, which, in combination, gave His Majesty the inclination and the leisure to pursue his own amusements, such as they were. The reader may rest assured that, if these two changes have more far-reaching effects than we intend to describe at this moment, we will discuss them as occasion warrants.The messenger, Seb, to whom we now have the honor of returning, performed the proper obeisance before His Majesty and said, "I bring you, Sire, greetings from the holdings of Her Highness, Sennya, and I bear herwishes that Your Majesty will deign to hear the message she has done me the honor to entrust to my care, and which she desires me to impart to Your Majesty.""The greetings," said His Majesty, "are acknowledged. And we are anxious to hear whatever intelligence you bring us.""Then, Sire, I will at once relay this message.""And you will be right to do so. Is it written?""No, Sire, it was entrusted to me, by Sennya herself, from mouth to ear.""Then you may deliver it the same way.""I shall do so, Sire," said Seb. She cleared her throat and began. "This is it, then: Sire, Her Highness, Sennya, faced with a personal crisis of the most extreme character, begs to be excused from the Meeting of the Principalities. She hopes she has not too much incurred Your Majesty's displeasure by making this request, and hopes, moreover, that Your Majesty will do her the kindness of granting it."His Majesty frowned, and the Orb took on a slight orange cast. He then looked around, and his eyes fell on the barrel-chested form of Jurabin, who was moving, or rather, bulling, his way through the courtiers to reach the throne. His Majesty stirred impatiently; Seb appeared quite at ease, although a few courtiers noticed that a certain amount of perspiration was evident at her temples.Jurabin arrived at last, and leaned forward to allow His Majesty to whisper to him. His Majesty quickly explained what had transpired, and Jurabin, upon hearing the news, looked at His Majesty with an expression of mild surprise, and accompanied the look by pronouncing these words, "But, Sire, what question does Your Majesty do me the honor to ask?"His Majesty flushed slightly, and the courtiers, who were unable to hear this conversation, noticed that the Orb darkened. "In the first place, Beespatch," said the Emperor, referring to Jurabin by title, as His Majesty always did when annoyed, "It was my opinion that you, as Prime Minister, ought to be made aware that yet another Delegate--in fact, an Heir--has backed out of the meeting. Other than that, I have not done you the honor to ask you a question, although, if I may make a suggestion--" His Majesty's voice was heavy with sarcasm--"you may want to consider whether we ought to no longer accept excuses of any kind. If this continues, no one will be at the meeting at all."Jurabin perceived that he had, perhaps, annoyed His Majesty a little. He said, "Forgive me, Sire. My poor brain is straining to bear what is, perhaps, too much of a load, and so if I am brusque with my sovereign, believe there is no disrespect intended."His Majesty relaxed, and signified with a wave of his hand that it was of nomoment. Jurabin continued, "If my advice in the matter is of any use to Your Majesty--"The Emperor signified that his advice was welcome."--I would say that by refusing to accept these excuses, Your Majesty would run the risk of being called a tyrant. Moreover, this is only the forty-sixth cancellation, which means we can still expect over two hundred delegates, which seems to me sufficient.""Mmmmph," said His Majesty. "That depends how many more cancellations there are."Jurabin bowed, but did not reply, seeing that he had convinced the Emperor, who then addressed the waiting messenger with the words, "Very well, the request is granted. Give your mistress my warmest regards.""I will not fail to do so, Sire," said the messenger, who then backed away from His Majesty, bowed low, and left the room to return to her mistress. As she left, the Emperor turned to his Prime Minister and said, "I wish to have two words with you, Jurabin.""Of course, Sire. I hope I have not been so unfortunate as to incur Your Majesty's displeasure.""No, no, but this last messenger has brought to mind certain matters, and I wish to discuss them with you.""As you wish, Sire. But allow me to point out that the time Your Majesty does your courtiers the honor of spending with them--""Is up even at this moment, Jurabin. Will you grant my wish for a few minutes of conversation?""Of course, Sire.""Then attend me. We will go to the Seven Room.""Lead, Sire; I will follow."His Majesty rose, whereupon all of the lords and ladies of the court who had managed to find chairs rose as well, and the entire assemblage fell silent and faced his Majesty, who sketched them a perfunctory salute. He looked around for the officer on duty to escort him, and found this officer standing imperturbably at his side."The Seven Room," said his Majesty.The officer bowed, and led the way through the throng, which parted before him. The Emperor and the Prime Minister followed at a leisurely pace; the Orb, a pale green, serenely circled His Majesty's head as he walked. Upon leaving the hall via the Mirrored Doors, which a servant hastily opened, the officer led the way down the Teak Passage, up the Green Stairway, and so to the room with seven walls where His Majesty most liked to hold private conversations. The officer himself opened the one door to this room, and, after satisfying himself that the room was unoccupied, stood aside for His Majestyand the Prime Minister to enter, after which he closed the door and placed himself in front of it.His Majesty sat in his favorite chair--a gold-colored chair with thick stuffing and a small matching footrest--and indicated that Jurabin should sit as well. When the Prime Minister had done so, in a plain chair facing His Majesty, the latter said, without preamble, "What have you been doing, Jurabin, about the finances of the Empire?""Sire," said Jurabin, who appeared to be caught slightly off guard, "I have been doing all that can be done.""And that includes?""Not a day goes by, Sire, that I do not endeavor to find some new economy. Today, for example, I--""New economies, Jurabin? Is that all that can be done?""That is all, Sire, until the Meeting of the Principalities.""Ah, yes, the meeting. The meeting to which we have just received yet another cancellation. Jurabin, if the meeting is to take place, the Princes and Deputies ought to begin arriving within the week.""Perhaps, Sire," said Jurabin; who, while he seemed mildly startled at His Majesty's sudden interest in matters of policy, did not appear unduly concerned about the presence or absence of the Princes and Deputies.His Majesty shifted impatiently. "Will you deny, in any case, that this rash of cancellations has the smell of conspiracy?"Jurabin cocked his head. "There is a certain fragrance, Sire, but sometimes we think someone is cooking fish, when, in fact, we are only near the ocean.""I usually know when I'm at the shore, Jurabin," said His Majesty."How is that, Sire?""Because my feet are wet."Jurabin bowed at this witticism His Majesty did him the honor to share, and said, "Well, then, Sire, are your feet wet?""If there is a conspiracy around me, Jurabin," said the Emperor, "I am unable to see it.""It is not, perhaps, a conspiracy, Sire," said the Prime Minister, "either around us here, or among the Princes.""It is not?""Perhaps not.""Then, you are saying that perhaps it is?""That is not precisely my meaning either, Sire.""Well then," said the Emperor, "What is your meaning?""To speak plainly--""The Gods!" His Majesty burst out. "It is nearly time for you to do so!""I believe that many of the Deputies are, quite simply, afraid to appear.""Afraid?" cried the Emperor. "How, Sennya, a Dzurlord, afraid?"Jurabin shrugged.

She studied writing at Johns Hopkins University and worked as a reporter for the <i>Baltimore Evening Sun</i> before moving to Japan, whre she taught English and began writing mystery fiction. The Rei Shimura series starts with <i>The Salaryman's Wife,</i> which won the Agatha Award for best first novel of 1997, and continues with <i>Zen Attitude,</i> and Edgar and Anthony nominee, and <i>The Flower Master.</i> At present Sujata Massey lives with her family in Baltimore and travels to Japan to research future Rei Shimura novels.Novelist and former Baltimore Evening Sun reporter Massey (The Salaryman's Wife) takes readers on a thoughtful tour of contemporary Japanese youth culture in this accomplished murder mystery. Rei Shimura is a Japanese-American antiques dealer who, looking to supplement her income, has begun writing a column for the Gaijin Times, Tokyo's English-language newspaper. When the paper's owner decides to transform the publication from a conventional news outlet to a comic book magazine, Shimura gets what is, for her, an unwanted assignment--to write an article on the history and culture of manga, or Japanese comic books. The newspaper asks Rika Fuchida, an ambitious student intern, to assist her, but Shimura prefers the assistance of her new boyfriend, Takeo Kayama. With his help, she discovers Mars Girl--a manga that follows the adventures of a superhero who, like Shimura, is bicultural (half-Martian, half-Japanese)--and the Showa Story, in which the superhero travels back in time, to 1930s Japan. Determined to keep her job at the newspaper, Shimura pursues Mars Girl's creator, Kunio Takahashi, in both the hip and the less-than-savory sides of Tokyo. Things begin to get shady, however, when Shimura is injured falling down a flight of stairs (was she pushed?) and when one of Takahashi's friends turns up dead, dressed as Mars Girl, in a river. Shimura begins to suspect that she is being followed, not only by her "assistant," the ambitious intern, but also by gangsters. Deftly sketching everyday life in parts of Tokyo rarely seen by tourists, Massey tells a series of overlapping stories about identity, the popular media and the hilarious frenzy of contemporary comic book culture.

For the Old African had the power to see the color of a person&#x2019;s soul and read his thoughts as if they were words on a page. Now it was time to act&#x2014;time to lead his fellow slaves to the Water-That-Stretched-Forever, and from there back to Africa. Back to their home.<p>Based on legend and infused with magical realism, this haunting tale is beautiful in both its language and its images. Julius Lester and Jerry Pinkney have found a new, extraordinary way to express the horrors of slavery and the hope and strength that managed to overcome its grip.</p></p><p>Born in 1939, Julius Lester spent his youth in the Midwest and the South and received a B.A. in English from Fisk University in 1960.<p>Since 1968 he has published 25 books of fiction, nonfiction, children's books, and poetry. Among the awards these books have received are the Newbery Honor Medal, American Library Association Notable Book, National Jewish Book Award Finalist, <i>The New York Times</i> Outstanding Book, National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist, Caldecott Honor Book, the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, and a National Book Award Finalist. His books have been translated into eight languages.</p><p>He has published more than one hundred essays and reviews in such publications <i>The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times </i>Op-Ed Page,<i>The Boston Globe, The Village Voice, The New Republic, Katallagete, Moment, Forward, and Dissent</i>.</p><p>He has recorded two albums of original songs, hosted and produced a radio show on WBAI-FM in New York City for eight years, and hosted a live television show on WNET in New York for two years. A veteran of the Civil Rights Movement, his photographs of that movement are included in an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution and are part of the permanent photographic collection at Howard University.</p><p>After teaching at the New School for Social Research for two years, Mr. Lester joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts/Amherst in 1971 where he is presently a full professor in the Judaic and Near Eastern Studies Department, and adjunct professor in the English and History departments. He also serves as lay religious leader of Beth El Synagogue in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.</p><p>He has been awarded all four of the university's most prestigious faculty awards: The Distinguished Teacher's Award; the Faculty Fellowship Award for Distinguished Research and Scholarship; Distinguished Faculty Lecturer; and recipient of the Chancellor's Medal, the University's highest honor. In 1986 the Council for Advancement and Support of Education selected him as the Massachusetts State Professor of the Year.</p><p>Mr. Lester's biography has appeared in <i>Who's Who In America</i> since 1970. He has given lectures and papers at more than 100 colleges and universities.</p><p>His most recent books are <i>John Henry, And All Our Wounds Forgiven</i>, a novel about the civil rights movement, and <i>Othello</i>, a novel based on the Shakespeare play.</p><p>Jerry Pinkney has been illustrating children's books since 1964 and has the rare distinction of being the recipient of:</p><p>Five Caldecott Honor Medals</p><p>Five Coretta Scott King Awards</p><p>Four New York Times Best Illustrated Awards (most recently 2006 <i>Little Red Hen</i>)</p><p>Four Gold and four Silver medals from the Society of Illustrators</p><p>Boston Globe Honor Book Award (<i>John Henry</i> 1994)</p><p>In addition to his work on children's books, he is an extremely successful artist who has had eleven one-man retrospectives at venues ranging from the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists to the Art Institute of Chicago. His current one-man show entitled, "Building Bridges, the Art of Jerry Pinkney" was organized by the Pittsburgh Children's Museum and will be traveling through 1998. Mr. Pinkney has illustrated for a wide variety of clients, including <i>National Geographic</i> , the National Parks Service, the U.S. Postal Service, the <i>American Library Association</i> and the <i>Association of Booksellers for Children</i>.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1939, Jerry Pinkney states, "(I) took an interest in drawing very early in my life, and at some point I realized I'd rather sit and draw than do almost anything else." While growing up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia his interest in art was supported by hisfamily -- especially by his mother. "She certainly understood me and made it clear to everyone that if art was what I wanted to pursue, then that's what she wanted to have happen. My father also became very supportive, and when I wanted to take art classes after school he found ways for me to attend."</p><p>In junior high school Mr. Pinkney had a newsstand and took a drawing pad with him to work every day and sketched passersby. That was how he met the cartoonist John Liney, who encouraged him to draw and showed him the possibilities of making a living as an artist.</p><p>After graduating from the commercial art program at Dobbins Vocational School, where he met his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, Jerry Pinkney received a full scholarship to attend the Philadelphia Museum College of Art (now University of the Arts). While at PCA he and Gloria married. After their first child was born, they moved to Boston, where Mr. Pinkney worked as a designer at Rustcraft Greeting Card Company, and at Barker-Black Studio where he developed his reputation as an illustrator. Eventually he opened Kaleidoscope Studio with two other artists. Later he opened his own freelance studio -- Jerry Pinkney Studio -- and moved to New York. Sensitivity to and an interest in a variety of cultures has always been a dominant theme of Mr. Pinkney s work. He has also drawn inspiration for a significant part of his work from African American culture. Among his numerous projects are his twelve postage stamps for the U.S. Postal Service Black Heritage series. Mr. Pinkney was a member of its Advisory Committee for ten years and he was also invited to join the NASA artist team for the space shuttle Columbia. "I wanted to show that an African American artist could make it on a national level in the graphic arts. I want to be a strong role model for my family and for other African Americans."</p><p>Many of Mr. Pinkney's children's books celebrate multicultural and African American themes. "Working on both the <i>Uncle Remus</i> tales and <i>John Henry</i> has shown me an important link between pivotal and opposite African American folk heroes. Brer Rabbit, the sly trickster, originated during slavery and was the first African American folk hero. Slaves who wanted to get the better of their masters needed to be cunning and sly -- hence the trickster role. However, later comes John Henry, a free man, whose strength and valor bring him fame. He was a strong folk hero for African Americans, a symbol of all the working men who made a major contribution to the building of the roads and railroads in the mountains of West Virginia -- a dangerous job for which many paid with their lives."</p><p>Mr. Pinkney's two latest books are<i>The Little Red Hen</i> and <i>The Old African</i> by Julius Lester (illustrated by Jerry Pinkney). Books give me a great feeling of personal and artistic satisfaction. When I'm working on a book, I wish the phone would never ring. I love doing it. My satisfaction comes from the actual marks on the paper, and when it sings, it's magic".</p><p>Jerry and Gloria Pinkney live in Westchester County, New York. The Pinkneys have four children: Troy, Scott, Brian, and Myles, and seven grandchildren. Two of the Pinkney's children are also involved in children's book illustration, Brian through illustrations, and Myles throughphotography. In addition to illustrating children's books and other projects, Mr. Pinkney has also been an art professor at the University of Delaware and State University of New York at Buffalo. He has given workshops and been a guest lecturer at universities and art schools across the country.</p>"Whips sink into bare flesh and red blood glistens in Lester&#x2019;s painfully vivid, four-part story of the horrors of slavery that evolves into a fantastical escape myth. When a runaway boy named Paul is brutally beaten by Master Riley, his anguish triggers a flashback of the magical, shape-shifting Old African to the terror and stench of the slave ships he experienced ten years previous. Paul&#x2019;s vision inspired cry &#x201c;Water! Water!&#x201d; stirs the Old African to lead the slaves off the plantation to the ocean, the Water-That-Stretched- Forever. Fully clothed, the slaves walk into the waves to their freedom, down onto the ocean floor, over the bones of fellow captured slaves, all the way back to Africa where their homecoming is joyful and triumphant. Both author and artist draw on a story originating with the Ybo slaves of coastal Georgia for this moving collaboration. Lester&#x2019;s prose is powerful and poetic, and Pinkney outdoes himself in hauntingly expressive, often wordless double-page paintings that masterfully capture the strength and suffering of the African people." <br><b>-Kirkus Reviews, starred review</b><p>"Lester&#x2019;s story is based on a legend about Ybo Landing, GA, where a group of slaves walked into the water, saying they were walking to Africa. His resulting novella-length allegory about spirit, memory, and freedom shows how hope can live in a people even when the spirit dies... Lester and Pinkney combine their talents here to create an unusual, complex, and thought-provoking offering in which the Old African is the keeper of a power that brings comfort and, ultimately, salvation to his people." <br><b>-School Library Journal, starred review</b></p></p><h2>Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons (D&amp;D Rules Expansion)</h2><p>All about the most popular monsters of <b>D&amp;D</b>--the dragons!<br><br><i>Draconomicon I: Chromatic Dragons</i> describes several varieties of dragons, including red, blue, green, black, and white dragons, as well as three completely new chromatic dragons.<br><br>This sourcebook gives details of each dragon's powers, tactics, myths, lairs, servitors, and more.

But he also dreams of being more than a herd boy someday: Malusi wants to be president.<br> This simple but poignant story explores the idea that many great leaders have come from humble beginnings. Perhaps what gives someone the strength and integrity to lead well isn't so different from what it takes to be a good herd boy.</p><p>Niki Daly has written and illustrated a number of award-,winning picture books, including Pretty Salma(Clarion), Ruby Sings the Blues (Bloomsbury),and Jamela&#39;s Dress (Frances Lincoln). Niki livesin Cape Town, South Africa.,It&#x2019;s a big job for a small boy. Malusi cares for his grandfather&#x2019;s sheep and goats, and this title&#x2019;s dramatic, accessible images show him working barefoot in the South African veld as he shouts at the hungry baboon who hopes to grab a lamb (Hamba! Go away!), and he is careful to avoid the snake coiled up beneath the grass. His friend laughs when Malusi shares his dream of becoming president. But then one day, a big car, shiny and new, stops at the village, and the passenger (whom many will recognize as Nelson Mandela) tells the boys that, at their age, he also looked after sheep. Daly&#x2019;s beautiful watercolor artwork&#x2014;rendered in thick black lines and lots of red and green accents&#x2014;captures the daily struggle in the poor, rural village from the child&#x2019;s viewpoint as well as the beauty and the harshness of the landscape. The back matter includes a note confirming that Mandela was indeed a herd boy in his village, and a glossary that reflects the rich South African mix across cultures.

He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world.

It rolls out of the garden flattening the cat, crashing through the clothesline, knocking over trash cans, and scaring the pants off two elderly gents. "Poor Nelly was worried./She said, 'Oh my gosh,/there's got to be some way/to slow down this squash." After wondering what to do with the huge vegetable, the woman has an idea. She scoops and scrapes all night long, and when morning comes, she is curled up in a chair sleeping in her new squash house. This simple plot does not develop the tensions or motivations needed for a satisfying story. Why, for example, did Mrs. McNosh work desperately all night long to make a new house? The rhyming text creates a lighthearted bounce, but some of the rhymes seem forced. The watercolor-and-ink cartoon illustrations provide humor and a clear sense of action and movement. Perhaps some young listeners will enjoy the silliness of a giant, out-of-control plant tamed for a cozy place to sleep, but the undeveloped story line will limit the book's general appeal.<br><i>Adele Greenlee, Bethel College, St. Paul, MN </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mirror to America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin</h2><p>John Hope Franklin lived through America&#x2019;s most defining twentieth-century transformation, the dismantling of legally protected racial segregation. A renowned scholar, he has explored that transformation in its myriad aspects, notably in his 3.5-million-copy bestseller, <i>From Slavery to Freedom</i>. Born in 1915, he, like every other African American, could not help but participate: he was evicted from whites-only train cars, confined to segregated schools, threatened&#x2014;once with lynching&#x2014;and consistently subjected to racism&#x2019;s denigration of his humanity. Yet he managed to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard; become the first black historian to assume a full professorship at a white institution, Brooklyn College; and be appointed chair of the University of Chicago&#x2019;s history department and, later, John B. Duke Professor at Duke University. He has reshaped the way African American history is understood and taught and become one of the world&#x2019;s most celebrated historians, garnering over 130 honorary degrees. But Franklin&#x2019;s participation was much more fundamental than that.<br><br>From his effort in 1934 to hand President Franklin Roosevelt a petition calling for action in response to the Cordie Cheek lynching, to his 1997 appointment by President Clinton to head the President&#x2019;s Initiative on Race, and continuing to the present, Franklin has influenced with determination and dignity the nation&#x2019;s racial conscience. Whether aiding Thurgood Marshall&#x2019;s preparation for arguing <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> in 1954, marching to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965, or testifying against Robert Bork&#x2019;s nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987, Franklin has pushed the national conversation on race toward humanity and equality, a life long effort that earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x2019;s highest civilian honor, in 1995. Intimate, at times revelatory, <i>Mirror to America</i> chronicles Franklin&#x2019;s life and this nation&#x2019;s racial transformation in the twentieth century, and is a powerful reminder of the extent to which the problem of America remains the problem of color.<br></p><p><p>Praise for author John Hope Franklin: </p><p>"A pioneer scholar; a splendid humanist and a shining model to generations of students, scholars, and activists." --David Levering Lewis, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, 1994</p>John Hope Franklin is James B.

National ad/promo.</p><p>Powerful study of a life in Hitler's service, by Bloch (The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor, 1989, etc.). Bloch's young Ribbentrop is a shallow, friendly man of the middle class, characterized in early manhood by a love of sports and music, excellent manners, and snobbery (he added a phony ``von'' to his name). Son of a career officer, his education was slighted, but he traveled (as far as Canada) and made friends outside Germany, and his liquor-importing business strengthened these connections. Bloch makes clear that, into the early 30's, Ribbentrop was liberal in outlook, with Jewish friends, and that his international experience and personal finesse, rare in Nazi circles, were prized beyond their worth by Hitler, who assumed they indicated real sophistication. Ribbentrop acquired recognition by assisting in the maneuvers that made Hitler chancellor, and, in 1938, he was appointed Germany's foreign minister. He had diplomatic aspirations but neither gifts nor training and, as Bloch indicates, career diplomats of all nationalities abhorred him. Familiarity with the period and its major figures allows Bloch to present a detailed example of how Nazi Germany operated: Using Ribbentrop the social-climber, Hitler undermined and spied on the distrusted diplomatic service. Ongoing rivalries with Goebbels, Goering, and other Nazis represented here reveal a world in which everyone was set against everyone else by the master, and in which everything depended on his whim. Ribbentrop, acclimated to domination by his wife, was good at the game, debasing himself to the point where he was completely dependent on Hitler's approval for his state of mind. By the time Germany occupied Norway, Ribbentrop had become a raging anti-Semite--a changed man whose harangues in delicate diplomatic situations rivalled those of Hitler himself. Bloch controls his material expertly, balancing personal and historic elements to produce a fascinating, cautionary tale. (Sixteen-page b&amp;w photo insert--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler's foreign minister, played a prominent but by no means essential role in the formation of the Rome-Berlin Axis and the 1939 Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact, we're reminded here. Additionally, he took part in planning the attack on Poland that set off WW II. Bloch also introduces new material about Ribbentrop's role in Hitler's 1933 ascension to power, his tenure as German ambassador in London (alienating much of the British populace with his arrogance), his participation in anti-Jewish policies as foreign minister and his harebrained scheme to kidnap the Duke of Windsor. This involving, revealing biography of Hitler's yes-man makes clear that Ribbentrop was wanting in character and ideas and that his pompous manner made him an international buffoon. Still unanswered is the question of why Hitler retained him in such an important post. Ribbentrop was convicted at Nuremberg and hanged as a war criminal in 1946. Bloch is the author of The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Painted Paper: Techniques &amp; Projects for Handmade Books &amp; Cards</h2><p>Create decorated papers as beautiful as any found in an art store!

Now this major contribution to the social and cultural history of the period&#x2014;with its informative text and hundreds of photographs&#x2014;is available in paperback once again. As The Washington Post said, Kiki's Paris "celebrates the people who made the modern movement in art, music and literature, most of whom were friends or lovers of Kiki, the woman Hemingway called 'The Queen of Montparnasse.'"</p></p><p><i>Kiki's Paris: Artists and Lovers 1900-1930</i> presents a delightful evocation of the life of Alice Prin, or Kiki, and her generation in Paris--from her favorite caf�s and the cramped artists' studios where she modeled to her relationships with so many of the great artists of the period. The historical and personal details culled from books, memoirs, and letters alone would constitute a fabulous biography; with the photographs--more than 650--the book is transformed into a work of art in its own right. <i>Publisher's Weekly</i> raves, "Kiki ... was outrageous, charming, beautiful, talented--and so is the Paris that emerges.

Graduates of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, they progressed to an idyllic existence together on a quasi-English country estate just outside Philadelphia. Financed by commissions from major publishers and architects, and buoyed up by public and critical acclaim that took no offence at their bohemian lifestyle, everything seemed perfect - until various problems arose and one of them opted out for conventional marriage to a man.

Whether one shares his optimism or not, he makes a compelling case that the future of the world will be determined on the streets of our cities.&#x201d; &#x2014;Mike Davis, from the Foreword</p><p>&#x201c;A World of Gangs is an illuminating journey around the cultures, lives, tragedies, and dreams of millions of rebellious youth around the planet. It is an indispensable work to understand the world we live in and essential reading for students of cities and communities.&#x201d; &#x2014;Manuel Castells</p><p>For the more than a billion people who now live in urban slums, gangs are ubiquitous features of daily life. Though still most closely associated with American cities, gangs are an entrenched, worldwide phenomenon that play a significant role in a wide range of activities, from drug dealing to extortion to religious and political violence. In A World of Gangs, John Hagedorn explores this international proliferation of the urban gang as a consequence of the ravages of globalization. </p><p>Looking closely at gang formation in three world cities-Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, and Capetown-he discovers that some gangs have institutionalized as a strategy to confront a hopeless cycle of poverty, racism, and oppression. In particular, Hagedorn reveals, the nihilistic appeal of gangsta rap and its street ethic of survival &#x201c;by any means necessary&#x201d; provides vital insights into the ideology and persistence of gangs around the world. This groundbreaking work concludes on a hopeful note. Proposing ways in which gangs might be encouraged to overcome their violent tendencies, Hagedorn appeals to community leaders to use the urgency, outrage, and resistance common to both gang life and hip-hop in order to bring gangs into broader movements for social justice.</p><p>John M. Hagedorn is associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He is editor of Gangs in the Global City and author of the highly influential People and Folks: Gangs, Crime, and the Underclass in a Rustbelt City.</p><p>MacArthur fellow Mike Davis is the author of many books, including Planet of Slums and, most recently, Buda&#x2019;s Wagon: A Brief History of the Car Bomb.</p></p><p>John M. Hagedorn is associate professor of criminal justice and senior research fellow at Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He is editor of Gangs in the Global City; co-editor of Female Gangs in America: Essays on Girls, Gangs, and Gender; and author of the highly influential People and Folks: Gangs, Crime, and the Underclass in a Rustbelt City. MacArthur fellow Mike Davis is professor of history at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of many books, including Planet of Slums, City of Quartz, and Ecology of Fear.Hagedorn (<i>People and Folks</i>), a scholar of gangland culture for more than 20 years, contends that gangs have existed since the Roman Republic and will continue to thrive as long as globalization continues to create untenable situations for the urban poor. Hagedorn surveys street gangs from Mumbai, Paris, L.A., Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town and 15th-century Florence, examining the role race and ethnicity play in gang formation (the white Gaylords of Chicago, the Latin Kings) and how the gang itself can be regarded as an alternative social institution, providing protection and economic opportunities for neglected populations. Hagedorn's description of gangs as institutionalized living organisms explains why they are so difficult to eradicate. Although Hagedorn is an undeniable authority on the topic and has logged plenty of face time with gang members, his work relies rather heavily on analyzing academic studies as opposed to providing in-depth descriptions of his own firsthand observations. His focus on old school gangsta rap also reveals a slight disconnect from his youthful subjects, as he refers to pass� artists such as Cypress Hill as popular modern-day performers. While Hagedorn has produced a well-organized, well-researched and sensitive study, readers hungry for more ethnographic accounts should turn to Sudhir Venkatesh's <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i>. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

July 1, 1994, began a period that I can best describe as a long, cold winter--a stark, lonely season during which I found myself without all the things that gave me comfort, purpose, meaning, and identity. It helped a little that I entered this season willingly. It was a necessary transition from a very successful, almost twenty-three years in Fullerton, California, to an uncertain future in Dallas, Texas. I never doubted that I was where the Lord would have me and I knew it would be difficult, but I never imagined just how much it would challenge my character and stretch my faith. I felt more than lonely. I felt alone. </p> <p>I was living in a small apartment over a friend's garage while pouring myself into my new duties as president of Dallas Theological Seminary, the institution that had launched me into ministry thirty-one years earlier. The world of academic theology, while strange to me, was stimulating. Those with whom I worked could not have been more gracious and kind . . . but nothing was familiar. It would be another two years before we could move the headquarters of Insight for Living from California to Texas, so Cynthia had to divide her time between Anaheim and Dallas. That left me with a lot of solitude, something I typically enjoy. But this was far more than I had anticipated or wanted. I was separated from all of my children and grandchildren for the first time since they were born. The deep friendships I had cultivated for twenty-three years were fifteen hundred miles away. The home we had lived in and enjoyed belonged to someone else, and the ministry that had given me such joy and fulfillment was now only a memory. Moreover, I was a shepherd without sheep. That loss kept me on my face before God. </p></p><h2>Sepia Dreams: A Celebration of Black Achievement Through Words and Images</h2><p><p><i>Sepia Dreams</i> is a collection of wise words from and beautiful images of fifty black celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, art, sports, and more.

No glossy photos; just 700 pages of wonderful recipes and instruction in basics such as bread-making. And all with the kind of detailed teaching left out of books that give more space to pictures than to text. A classic.&#39; Guardian &#39;Truly indispensable&#39; -- Nigel Slater</p><p>Perhaps more than any other person, Marcella Hazan is responsible for bringing Italian cuisine into the homes of American cooks. We're not talking spaghetti and meatballs here--Hazan's cuisine consists of polenta, risotto, squid braised with tomatoes and white wine, saut�ed swiss chard with olive oil and garlic.... Twenty years ago, when Hazan first exploded into the American consciousness with <i>The Classic Italian Cook Book</i> and <i>More Classic Italian Cooking</i>, such recipes were revolutionary. With time, however, these classic dishes have become much-beloved family favorites. <p> Now a new generation is ready to be introduced to Marcella Hazan's way with food, and in <i>Essentials of Italian Cooking</i> Hazan combines her two earlier works into one update and expanded volume. In addition to the delicious collection of recipes, this book serves as a basic manual for cooks of every skill level. Recipes have been revised to reduce fat content, and a whole new chapter full of fundamental information about herbs, spices, and cheeses used in Italian kitchens--as well as details on how to select specific ingredients--has been added.

The subject of a just released biography by Tracy Kidder, Farmer is the author of The Uses of Haiti, Infections and Inequalities, and AIDS and Accusation. Greg Bates is Publisher at Common Courage Press.In this impassioned, sometimes unwieldly, synthesis of history and report, Harvard-based Farmer, who alternates research with medical practice in rural Haiti, offers an indictment of American policy. He traces Haiti's long standing injustice from the sufferings of the 18th century slave economy, and the post-revolution establishment of a still-persistent feudal economy to the U.S. Marine invasion in 1915 and our subsequent support, based on business interests and anticommunism, for tyrants like Papa Doc Duvalier. The democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide was deposed in a 1991 coup shortly after he began to redress Haiti's ugly inequalities; Farmer (AIDS and Accusation) notes how media reports meshed with the Bush administration's line, and criticizes the Clinton administration's inaction. Departing from his historical narrative, Farmer also decries harassing U.S. policy toward Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; describes the torture death of a peasant as an outgrowth of U.S. military training; and suggests that AIDS in Haiti should not be blamed on images of squalor, but more on "an established political and economic crisis." American remorse, he suggests, would be the first step toward a new commitment to justice. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gaining Skill with Arithmetic 5 (Teacher&#39;s Manual, Part 2 chapters 9-17)</h2><p>Gaining Skill with Arithmetic 5, Part 2</p><p></p><h2>Belle and the Beau</h2><p>It is 1859, and Daniel, an African-American, is educated and engaged to be married, but nothing can prepare him for the beautiful stranger from Kentucky who turns his world upside down.

In a fitting tribute to the two hundredth anniversary of Harriet Beecher Stowe's birth, Bancroft Prize-winning historian David S. Reynolds reveals her book's impact not only on the abolitionist movement and the American Civil War but also on worldwide events, including the end of serfdom in Russia, down to its influence in the twentieth century. He explores how both Stowe's background as the daughter in a famously intellectual family of preachers and her religious visions were fundamental to the novel. And he demonstrates why the book was beloved by millions&#x2015;and won over even some southerners&#x2015;while fueling lasting conflicts over the meaning of America. Although vilified over the years as often as praised, it has remained a cultural landmark, proliferating in the form of plays, songs, films, and merchandise&#x2015;a rich legacy that has both fed and contested American racial stereotypes. 41 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>David S.

Paying special attention to her experience of faith, Lundin skillfully relates Dickinsons life as it can be charted through her poems and letters to nineteenth-century American political, social, religious, and intellectual history. This second edition of Lundins superb work includes a standard bibliography, expanded notes, and a more extensive discussion of Dickinsons poetry than the first edition contained. Besides examining Dickinsons singular life and work in greater depth, Lundin has also keyed all poem citations to the recently updated standard edition of Dickinsons poetry. Already outstanding, Lundins biography of Emily Dickinson is now even better than before.</p><p>In this readable new biography of the reclusive poet, Wheaton English professor Lundin concentrates on Dickinson's ambivalence toward Christianity and its effects on the self. He traces her inner debate through a careful analysis of Dickinson's poems and letters, and he concludes that she was "one of the major religious thinkers of her age." According to Lundin, Dickinson's struggle with suffering and the character of God mirrored the major forcesADarwinism, the Civil War, the spread of industrialismAthat tested and altered American Protestantism. Lundin also contends that Dickinson's notion of God as silent and severe was drawn from her relationship with her father, Edward Dickinson, a remote patriarch who disdained the enthusiasm and emotion of religious revivals. The "Pugilist and Poet," as Dickinson described herself, longed to believe in God's loving care, but her sense of human frailty would not allow her wholly to accept His existence. In addition, she could not profess firsthand knowledge of the fruits of grace; nor could she detect any signs in her own soul of the holy joy that others claimed as they accepted Christ. Her choice of "poetry as a surrogate for traditional religious belief," writes Lundin, set her on a path to solitude, a path that led away from marriage, church and the world outside Amherst, Mass. Lundin's close readings of Dickinson's poetry and his careful analysis of Dickinson's historical and social context make a persuasive case for the implicit religious dimension of Dickinson's life and work. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lilith: A Romance</h2><p>ABOUT THE BOOK:- Lilith is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer.

Arguing that the indigenous roots of American liberal theology existed before the rise of Darwinism, Dorrien maintains that this tradition took shape in the nineteenth century and was motivated by a desire to map a progressive "third way" between authority-based orthodoxies and atheistic rationalism. Dorrien characterizes American liberal theology by its openness to historical criticism and evolutionary theory, its commitment to the authority of individual reason and experience, its conception of Christianity as an ethical way of life, and its commitment to make Christianity credible and socially relevant to modern people.</p></p><p><b>Gary Dorrien</b> is Reinhold Niebuhr Professor of Social Ethics at Union Theological Seminary and Professor of Religion at Columbia University in New York City. An Episcopal priest, he is the author of eleven books and over one hundred articles that range across the fields of theology, philosophy, social theory, politics, ethics, and history.As the first entry in a projected three-volume series on American liberal Christianity, this masterfully written work offers a biographical narrative of the 19th-century figures who, while influenced by English and German ideas, shaped an indigenous theology. Writers such as William E. Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Bushnell, Henry Ward Beecher, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Charles Briggs, and Borden Parker Bowne are all featured here. These thinkers developed modernist schools that sought to find a middle ground between orthodoxy and rationalism, claims Dorrien (The Barthian Revolt in Modern Theology). A significant feature is the author's coverage of the divinity schools at Harvard, Boston, Yale, and Chicago universities; surprisingly, he finds the most consistent theological liberalism at Boston University. He also describes the controversies these liberals engendered in the churches and the resulting heresy trials. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries.AJames A.

He presents a child's true needs--according to Scripture--and provides parents a realistic, do-able way to meet them. The result--spiritually strong children who grow up with a sense of calm and a heart full of purpose and confidence.</p><p>Parents will welcome <em>Grace-Based Parenting</em>.<br></p></p><p>Dr. Tim Kimmel is one of America&#39;s top advocates speaking for the family.

He lives with his family in Scottsdale, Arizona.Kimmel, author and founder of Family Matters ministries, likens many Christian parents' attempts at rearing children to putting together a puzzle without first studying the completed picture located on the box's cover. Kimmel states that families of faith tend toward extremes, either being overly permissive or overly legalistic. This is not a particularly new concept, but Kimmel pulls it off with interesting storytelling and sound biblical parallels. He says Christians frequently believe that the battle for a child's heart and soul is fought on the outside-with rigid rules and boundaries-when in fact just the opposite is true. He underscores the importance of communicating the unconditional love that Christ offers and affirming this timeless message of grace to one's family. Despite the numerous examples the author cites where parents fail, this text is overwhelmingly upbeat with hope and possibility: Parents who strive to live a life of faith characterized by daily trust in God will pass on this message of possibility and potential to their offspring. Kimmel asserts that this "radical" mode of parenting will meet the three essential needs in kids' lives: for security, significance and strength. He assures parents that these needs can be met with grace-laced love, purpose and hope. Kimmel's gentle heart is evident in every chapter, and his obvious passion will spur frustrated parents to keep at the task with new resolve and optimism. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was both a physical battle of shocking violence against a regime increasingly seen as alien and unacceptable and an intellectual battle for a new sort of country. The damage done, the betrayals and grim compromises put the new nation into a state of trauma for at least a generation, but at a nearly unacceptable cost the struggle ended: a new republic was born. Charles Townshend&#39;s Easter 1916 opened up the astonishing events around the Rising for a new generation and in The Republic he deals, with the same unflinchingly wish to get to the truth behind the legend, with the most critical years in Ireland&#39;s history. There has been a great temptation to view these years through the prisms of martyrology and good-and-evil. The picture painted by Townshend is far more nuanced and sceptical - but also never loses sight of the ordinary forms of heroism performed by Irish men and women trapped in extraordinary times. &#39;The author has devoted his life to the study of Irish history and this huge work is the pinnacle of his labours&#39; John Banville on Easter 1916</p><p>Charles Townshend is the author of the highly praised Easter 1916:The Irish Rebellion.

The five short stories of <i>The Late Tales of Ivan Petrovich Belkin</i> are lightly humorous and yet reveal astonishing human depths, and his short novel, <i>The Captain's Daughter</i>, has been called the most perfect book in Russian literature.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER PUSHKIN </b>(1799-1837) was a poet, playwright, and novelist who achieved literary prominence before he was twenty. His radical politics led to government censorship and periods of banishment from the capital, but he eventually married a popular society beauty and became a regular part of court life. Notoriously touchy about his honor, he died at age thirty-seven in a duel with his wife's alleged lover. <br><br><b>RICHARD PEVEAR</b> and <b>LARISSA VOLOKHONSKY</b> have translated works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol, Bulgakov, and Pasternak.

They are married and live in France.<p><b>Introduction </b><br> Alexander Pushkin was mortally wounded in a duel on the afternoon of January 27, 1837, at Chernaya Rechka, just outside Petersburg. &#x201c;It is thus that the figure of Pushkin remains in our memory&#x2014;with a pistol,&#x201d; Andrei Sinyavsky wrote in <i>Strolls with Pushkin.*</i> &#x201c;Little Pushkin with a big pistol. A civilian, but louder than a soldier. A general. An ace. Push�kin! Crude, but just. The first poet with his own biography&#x2014;how else would you have him up and die, this first poet, who inscribed himself with blood and powder in the history of art?&#x201d;<br><br> Pushkin was just thirty-seven when he died, but he had already been acknowledged as Russia&#x2019;s greatest poet, a title that has since been defined and redefined but never disputed. In the decade before his death, however, he had also become the true originator of Russian prose. Sinyavsky is right to say that Pushkin lives in Russian memory as more than a writer, more than a poet&#x2014;as &#x201c;Pushkin!&#x201d; In a speech delivered at a commemoration in revolutionary Petrograd in Febru�ary 1921, the poet Alexander Blok said: &#x201c;From early childhood our memory keeps the cheerful name: Pushkin. This name, this sound fills many days of our life. The grim names of emperors, generals, inven�tors of the tools of murder, the tormented and the tormentors of life. And beside them&#x2014;this light name: Pushkin.&#x201d; Yet his personal presence is in marked contrast with the essential impersonality of Pushkin&#x2019;s art. It is not that he celebrated himself and sang&nbsp;himself: he never did. In a letter to his friend Nikolai Raevsky, written in July 1825, Pushkin criti�cized Byron (whom he generally admired) for the constant intrusion of his personality: &#x201c;Byron . . . has parceled out among his characters such-and-such a trait of his own character; his pride to one, his hate to another, his melancholy to a third, etc.&#x201d;* And he contrasts Byron&#x2019;s practice with the multifarious receptivity he had come to admire in Shakespeare&#x2014;his &#x201c;negative capability,&#x201d; as Keats called it. Sinyavsky intensifies Keats&#x2019;s paradox: &#x201c;Emptiness is Pushkin&#x2019;s content. Without it he would not be full, he would not <i>be, </i>just as there is no fire without air, no breathing in without breathing out.&#x201d; Impersonality, openness, and lightness are the essential qualities of his prose.</p><br>Our collection includes Pushkin&#x2019;s few finished and published works of fiction&#x2014;<i>The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin, The Queen of Spades, Kirdjali, The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter</i>&#x2014;each different and all mas�terpieces. It also includes his experiments in various forms, borrowing from and parodying well-known European models, consciously trying out the possibilities of Russian prose. The closest he came to a self-portrait is perhaps the character of Charsky in the fragmentary <i>Egyp�tian Nights; </i>otherwise he appears in person only in the nonfictional <i>Journey to Arzrum, </i>where, as D. S. Mirsky wrote, &#x201c;he reached the limits of noble and bare terseness.&#x201d;<br>Pushkin&#x2019;s family on his father&#x2019;s side belonged to the old military-feudal aristocracy, the Russian boyars, dating back some six centuries to the founding of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. He proudly refers to their &#x201c;six-hundred-year standing&#x201d; more than once in his letters. He was also&nbsp;proud of the rebelliousness of some of his ancestors, o&#x2020;ne of whom was executed by Peter the Great for opposing his political reforms, another of whom (his grandfather) was imprisoned for pro�testing against the &#x201c;usurpation&#x201d; of the throne by the Prussian-born Catherine the Great. The new gentry that arose in the eighteenth cen�tury as a result of Peter&#x2019;s reforms more or less eclipsed the old boyars, and Pushkin&#x2019;s father was left with relatively modest means.<br>On his mother&#x2019;s side, Pushkin&#x2019;s ancestors bore the name of Ganni�bal, from his great-grandfather Ibrahim Gannibal. It was long thought (by Pushkin among others) that Ibrahim was the son of a minor Ethio�pian prince, though recently it has been argued that he came from the sultanate of Logone-Birni in Cameroon. In any case at around the age of five he was sent as a hostage or slave to the court of the Ottoman sultan in Istanbul, and a year later was either ransomed or stolen by Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, advisor to the Russian ambassador, and brought to Petersburg, where he was presented to Peter the Great. Peter was very taken with the boy, stood as godfather at his baptism, gave him the patronymic Petrovich from his own name, and had him educated in the best European fashion. Ibrahim rose to the rank of general, was granted nobility, and had a long military and political career in the reigns of Peter and his daughter Elizabeth. While serving in the French army in his youth he adopted the surname Gannibal, or Hannibal, after the great Carthaginian general.<br><br>Pushkin prized his African ancestry, and his African ancestor, highly, and when he decided, in 1827, to try his hand at a historical novel along the lines of Walter Scott&#x2019;s immensely popular <i>Waverley </i>(published in 1814), he chose the life of Ibrahim as his subject. The result was <i>The&nbsp;Moor of Peter the Great. </i>In an article published three years later, he observed: &#x201c;In our time, by the term novel we mean an histori�cal epoch developed in a fictional narrative.&#x201d;* And indeed, while the two protagonists, Ibrahim and Peter the Great, are fully historical, his portrayal of their interactions is almost entirely invented. We first meet Ibrahim during his military service in the decadent Paris of Philippe d&#x2019;Orl�ans&#x2019;s regency (1715&#x2013;1723), and hear mainly about the complica�tions of his love life, both in France and on his return to Russia. Peter, meanwhile, is busy building his new capital in the north, &#x201c;a vast fac�tory,&#x201d; as it appears to Ibrahim, and though the emperor is referred to at one point as &#x201c;the hero of Poltava, the powerful and terrible reformer of Russia,&#x201d; we see him mainly as the &#x201c;gentle and hospitable host&#x201d; of his godson. More historical and personal complexity is suggested in later chapters, in Peter&#x2019;s relations with the old boyar aristocrats and with the entrance of Ibrahim&#x2019;s rival Valerian, but Pushkin abandoned the novel just at that point and never went back to the <i>Waverley </i>manner.<br>That was in 1828. A year or two later, one of Pushkin&#x2019;s literary enemies, Faddei Bulgarin (Pushkin liked to call him &#x201c;Figlyarin,&#x201d; from <i>figlyar, </i>&#x201c;buffoon&#x201d;), wrote a scurrilous article about a certain unnamed poet whose grandfather was not a Negro prince, as he boasted, but had been bought by a sea captain for a bottle of rum. Pushkin replied in a <i>post scriptum </i>to his poem &#x201c;My Genealogy&#x201d;: &#x201c;That skipper was the glorious skipper / Who started our land moving, / Who forcefully took the helm of our native ship / And set it on a majestic course.&#x201d; Pushkin&#x2019;s awareness of himself as a descendant both of old boyar stock and of the reformer&#x2019;s black godson nourished his meditations on state power in all its contradictions. In the same year that he&nbsp;abandoned his first novel, he wrote the long poem <i>Poltava, </i>about Peter&#x2019;s decisive victory in 1709 over the Swedish forces of Charles XII, which led to the emergence of Russia as the predominant nation of northern Europe. The &#x201c;terrible reformer,&#x201d; grown more ambiguous and demonic in the grim figure of his statue, is also the subject of Pushkin&#x2019;s last long poem, <i>The Bronze Horseman, </i>written in 1833. D. S. Mirsky has called it &#x201c;the greatest work ever penned in Russian verse.&#x201d;<br><br>Pushkin&#x2019;s own confrontation with imperial power had begun many years earlier. After the defeat of Napoleon, Russian troops occupied Paris and camped along the Champs-�lys�es. The victorious coalition restored the French monarchy, but the young Russian officers picked up French revolutionary thinking in the process and came home with new notions of political liberty. French culture had been the dominant influence in Russia since the time of Catherine the Great, who reigned from 1762 until her death in 1796. The aristocracy spoke French, which was Pushkin&#x2019;s first language. In 1811, the emperor Alexander I founded a school which he called by the French name of <i>lyc�e </i>(<i>litsei </i>in Russian) in the imperial village of Tsarskoe Selo, some eighteen miles south of Petersburg, to give the sons of the aristocracy a European education, after which they were to take up important posts in govern�ment service. Pushkin was in the first class of thirty, and his years at the lyc�e remained central to his life. There he began to write poetry, first in French, then in Russian, and by the age of fourteen he had already seen his work published and praised. On graduating in 1817, he moved to Petersburg, where he held a nominal post in the service, which did not keep him from living a rather wild life, gambling, wom�anizing, dueling. In Petersburg he also got to know some of the young officers who had come back from&nbsp;Paris. He shared their thoughts and hopes, and in that spirit wrote a number of poems which were not very pleasing to the authorities. One of them, the ode &#x201c;Liberty,&#x201d; written as early as 1817, praises &#x201c;the exalted son of Gaul&#x201d; who sang of Liberty and denounced &#x201c;enthroned vice&#x201d; with its scourges, irons, and serfdom. Against &#x201c;lawless Authority&#x201d; it invokes &#x201c;the trustworthy shelter of the Law.&#x201d; This, along with some biting epigrams on various government officials, was finally too much even for the rather liberal Alexander. Pushkin was relieved of his post in Petersburg and &#x201c;exiled&#x201d; to the south, to serve in Ekaterinoslav, Kishinev, and finally Odessa.<br><br>Pushkin was absent from Petersburg from 1820 to 1826. During those years he wrote a great deal of poetry, some of it based on his travels to the Caucasus and the Crimea with General Nikolai Raevsky, a retired hero of the Napoleonic Wars, and his sons Alexander and Nikolai, who became his close friends. He detested life in backward Kishinev, which had been ceded to Russia by the Turks in 1812, man�aged to get transferred to Odessa, but caused himself trouble there as well, particularly with the beautiful young wife of the governor-general, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov. He wrote a notorious epigram about the governor-general:<br><br> Half milord, half merchant,<br> Half wise man, half ignoramus,<br> Half scoundrel, but there&#x2019;s hope<br> He&#x2019;ll finally become a full one.<br>The post office routinely opened Pushkin&#x2019;s mail, and in one let�ter found him sympathizing with the atheistic arguments of a local philosopher (a certain &#x201c;deaf Englishman&#x201d;). This was enough to allow Vorontsov to petition for Pushkin&#x2019;s removal from Odessa. By imperial order he&nbsp;was expelled from the service and confined to his mother&#x2019;s small estate at Mikhailovskoe, near Pskov, where he was to be kept under surveillance by his father and the local authorities.<br><br>In a way the two years of this &#x201c;house arrest&#x201d; were Pushkin&#x2019;s sal�vation. He was left free to read and to write, and he produced more than he had in the previous four years. Along with many of his finest lyric poems, which went into the collection he was gathering then and published in 1826, he finished his long poem <i>The Gypsies, </i>begun in Kishinev, wrote two more long poems, <i>The Bridegroom </i>and the comic parody <i>Count Nulin, </i>completed three chapters of his novel in verse <i>Evgeny Onegin, </i>and wrote his first and longest play, the historical trag�edy <i>Boris Godunov. </i>And he worked on yet another narrative poem, <i>Cleopatra, </i>parts of which eventually found their way into the prose/verse fragment <i>Egyptian Nights, </i>included in our collection.<br><br>In a letter to his brother in November 1824, he describes his typi�cal day: &#x201c;I write memoirs until dinner; I dine late. After dinner I ride on horseback. In the evening I listen to fairy tales, and thereby I am compensating for the insufficiencies of my accursed upbringing. How charming these fairy tales are!&#x201d; The storyteller was his former nanny, the house serf Arina Rodionovna, who at first was his only company on the estate. Pushkin was deeply struck by her tales, kept notes on them, and a few years later turned them into some of his finest poems: <i>Tsar Saltan, The Golden Cockerel, </i>and <i>The Dead Princess and the Seven Mighty Men. </i>He also collected her sayings and expressions, a trove of Russian speech that was part of the compensation for his &#x201c;accursed upbringing.&#x201d;<br><br>But his confinement to Mikhailovskoe saved him in a more literal sense as well. The young officers who had come back from France began to organize a movement for political reform and&nbsp;in 1816 founded a secret society called the Union of Salvation, based in Petersburg with branches in other cities. The Union later divided into the Northern Society in Petersburg and the Southern Society in the Ukraine. Their aims included the abolition of serfdom, the election of a legislative assembly, and the drafting of a constitution limiting the powers of the monarchy. The Southern Society, led by Colonel Pavel Pestel, went further, advocating universal suffrage and the abolition of the monar�chy. Both foresaw the inevitability of an armed uprising.<br>Their chance came in December 1825. The emperor Alexander died suddenly on December 1, at the age of forty-eight, leaving no direct heir. The elder of his two brothers, Constantine, had married a Polish woman and Roman Catholic, and had renounced his right of succession, but only Alexander knew of it. There was uncertainty for several weeks before the younger brother, Nicholas, was prevailed upon to accept the throne. The secret societies decided to take the opportunity of his coronation on December 26 to stage their uprising, earning themselves the name of Decembrists. Some three thousand soldiers, led by the young officers of the Northern Society, appeared in Senate Square in Petersburg, calling for the formation of a pro�visional government. A few days later the Southern Society incited a mutiny among the troops in the Ukraine. But the revolts were poorly organized and, after the initial shock, were quickly suppressed. The instigators were arrested; five of them, including Colonel Pestel and the poet Kondraty Ryleev, were executed, and another 120 were sent into permanent exile in Siberia.<br><br>Pushkin, like many of his young friends, shared the liberal ideas of the Decembrists. The Raevsky brothers had joined the Southern Society, though they pulled out of it some time before the uprising. He had made the acquaintance of Pestel during his time in Kishinev and had been struck by his forceful personality. Later, as he records in <i>Journey to Arzrum, </i>Pushkin ran into many former Decembrists who had been sent to serve in the Caucasus as &#x201c;punishment&#x201d; for their radi�cal views. In September 1826, during a private meeting in Moscow, the new emperor asked him where he would have been on December 26. Pushkin replied candidly: &#x201c;On Senate Square with the rebels.&#x201d;<br><br>That conversation took place soon after Nicholas decided to end Pushkin&#x2019;s exile. A messenger brought the news to Mikhailovskoe. Pushkin left the same day and on September 8 arrived in Moscow. The emperor met with him at once and explained his new situation. His work would no longer be subject to official censorship; instead it would be submitted for approval to the emperor himself. Pushkin, charmed by Nicholas&#x2019;s apparent benevolence during their meeting, took that as an honor, not ...</p><h2>Flauberts Parrot</h2><p>Man Booker Prize-winning author Julian Barnes' <i>Flaubert's Parrot</i> deals with Flaubert, parrots, bears and railways; with our sense of the past and our sense of abroad; with France and England, life and art, sex and death, George Sand and Louise Colet, aesthetics and redcurrant jam; and with its enigmatic narrator, a retired English doctor, whose life and secrets are slowly revealed.</p><p>Just what sort of book is <i>Flaubert's Parrot</i>, anyway? A literary biography of 19th-century French novelist, radical, and intellectual impresario Gustave Flaubert? A meditation on the uses and misuses of language? A novel of obsession, denial, irritation, and underhanded connivery? A thriller complete with disguises, sleuthing, mysterious meetings, and unknowing targets? An extended essay on the nature of fiction itself?<p> On the surface, at first, Julian Barnes's book is the tale of an elderly English doctor's search for some intriguing details of Flaubert's life. Geoffrey Braithwaite seems to be involved in an attempt to establish whether a particularly fine, lovely, and ancient stuffed parrot is in fact one originally "borrowed by G. Flaubert from the Museum of Rouen and placed on his worktable during the writing of <i>Un coeur simple</i>, where it is called Loulou, the parrot of Felicit�, the principal character of the tale."</p><p> What begins as a droll and intriguing excursion into the minutiae of Flaubert's life and intellect, along with an attempt to solve the small puzzle of the parrot--or rather parrots, for there are two competing for the title of Gustave's avian confrere--soon devolves into something obscure and worrisome, the exploration of an arcane Braithwaite obsession that is perhaps even pathological. The first hint we have that all is not as it seems comes almost halfway into the book, when after a humorously cantankerous account of the inadequacies of literary critics, Braithwaite closes a chapter by saying, "Now do you understand why I hate critics? I could try and describe to you the expression in my eyes at this moment; but they are far too discoloured with rage." And from that point, things just get more and more curious, until they end in the most unexpected bang.</p><p> One passage perhaps best describes the overall effect of this extraordinary story: "You can define a net in one of two ways, depending on your point of view. Normally, you would say that it is a meshed instrument designed to catch fish. But you could, with no great injury to logic, reverse the image and define the net as a jocular lexicographer once did: he called it a collection of holes tied together with string." Julian Barnes demonstrates that it is possible to catch quite an interesting fish no matter how you define the net. <i>--Andrew Himes</i></p>A kind of detective story, relating a cranky amateur scholar&#39;s search for the truth about Gustave Flaubert, and the obsession of this detective whose life seems to oddly mirror those of Flaubert&#39;s characters.</p><h2>The Citizen-Soldier; Or, Memoirs of a Volunteer (Collector&#39;s Library of the Civil War)</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

She explores the figure of the witch both as historical reality and as archetype - as Halloween hag and full-breasted seductress, as a lingering vestige of a primeval religion and a projection of fear of the unknown. Now, more than a decade after its original publication, Jong has added a new introduction to Witches, emphasizing the relevance and continued popularity of this beguiling topic.</p><p>Erica Jong is the author of the novels Fear of Flying, Shylock&#39;s Daughter, Inventing Memory, and Sappho&#39;s Leap. She has also written six volumes of poetry and a number of nonfiction works, including the memoir Fear of Fifty. Joseph A. Smith, a painter and sculptor, is a professor of fine arts at Pratt Institute in New York City.&#34;&#34;Nothing less than a complete transformation of our concept of withces--from loathsome hag to healing mother goddess--is what long accomplishes with panache in this sumptuousily and provacatively illustrated book.&#34;</p><h2>She Who Prays: A Woman&#39;s Interfaith Prayer Book</h2><p>A Prayer book designed to be used by individual women, as well as by those who are leading group prayer services. <br> <br> For nearly two millennia, Christian women have learned to pray in the language of other people's souls. From worshiping God as father to envisioning a holy life as a military campaign, they've been taught to approach the Divine with the hearts and minds of men. <br> <br> She Who Prays: A Woman's Interfaith Prayer Book offers women a new way to pray. It draws on feminine images of God, as well as the language and experience of women, to help women tap into their own rich and unique spirituality. With material from new translations of ancient Christian hymns and prayers, as well as original prayers in the Christian and other faith traditions, She Who Prays will help women speak to God in their own voices. <br> <br> Arranged in roughly the same format as the Book of Common Prayer, She Who Prays contains a seven-day cycle of daily prayer services, prayers for special occasions, and a woman-oriented liturgical calendar that honors the lives of women of all faiths. The book also contains four rituals marking such themes as healing, reconciliation, and new beginnings, and a prayer to be used while walking a labyrinth. <br> <br> An appendix provides information on world religions and instructions for group services.</p><p>Jane Richardson Jensen, an author, translator, and scholar specializing in early Christian literature, is co-chaplain of Clare's Place, a women's spirituality center in College Station, Texas. <p>Patricia Harris-Watkins, chaplain of Clare's Place, is a scholar specializing in English as a second language. She has taught workshops in dream interpretation and vision quests, and integrates her Native American spirituality with her Christian faith.</p>Although feminists of many Christian traditions are likely to find this book helpful, its most appreciative audience will likely be liturgical Christians who already follow a similar format in their daily prayers. The book is arranged in roughly the same manner as the Anglican/Episcopal Book of Common Prayer, but with female-friendly twists: The scripture readings, for example, don&#x2019;t typically come from the Bible because of what the authors call its "male-oriented and militaristic nature." Jensen and Harris-Watkins substitute readings from the Apocrypha and various other sources, including hymns of the early Church (nimbly translated from Syriac, Greek and Hebrew by Jensen). Also, the authors borrow readings from many different faith traditions, which are helpfully introduced in a special table at the end of the book. The book even includes a few craft suggestions for women to make items that are related to the prayer rites. In Anglican fashion, there are prayers for morning, noon and evening, and for specific seasons, occasions and rituals.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Once Hitler finished dismembering Czechoslovakia, he was ready to go to war over Poland a year later. But Hitler had always been eager to seize Czechoslovakia, no matter the consequences. So what if England and France had stood up to the Nazis from the start, and not eleven months later? That is the question behind the<i> War That Came Early </i>series.<br> &nbsp;<br> Four years later, the civil war in Spain drags on, even after General Franco&#x2019;s death. The United States, still neutral in Europe, fights the Japanese in the Pacific. Russia and Germany go toe-to-toe in Eastern Europe&#x2014;yet while Hitler stares east, not everything behind him is going as well as he would like. But nothing feeds ingenuity like the fear of losing. The Germans wheel out new tanks and planes, Japan deploys weapons of a very different sort against China, and the United States, England, and France do what they can to strengthen themselves against imminent danger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seen through the eyes of ordinary citizens caught in the maelstrom, this is a you-are-there chronicle of battle on land and sea and in the air. Here are terrifying bombing raids that shatter homes, businesses, and the rule of law. Here are commanders issuing orders that, once given, cannot be taken back. And here are the seeds of rebellion sown in blood-soaked soil.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a war in which sides are switched and allies trust one another only slightly more than they trust their mortal enemies, Nazi Germany has yet to send its Jews to death camps, and dangerous new nationalist powers arise in Eastern Europe. From thrilling submarine battles to the horror of men fighting men and machines all through Europe, <i>Two Fronts</i> captures every aspect of a brilliantly reimagined conflict: the strategic, the political, and the personal force of leaders bending nations to their wills.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Two Fronts</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;[Harry] Turtledove has another major twist in store for the readers and his alternative world.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>SF Site</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Turtledove&#x2019;s new variation on the theme of WWII is departing more and more from the original, sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes in less subtle ones. . . .

He had a cut from bomb shrapnel along one rib and another in the side of his neck. A couple of inches there and he would have been nothing but a snack for the shark that had circled him after he got blown off the Boise&#x2019;s deck and into the tropical Pacific.<br><br>He knew he was lucky to be alive. A lot of good men hadn&#x2019;t made it off the light cruiser before she sank. The bomb from a Jap Val that flung him overboard broke her back, and she went down fast.<br><br>That blast also flung him clear of the fuel oil from her shattered bunkers. You swallowed some of that crap, you were history even if they did fish you out of the drink. And, even though his cuts must have been bleeding like billy-be-damned, the dorsal went away instead of slicing in for the kill. Maybe he was an off brand.<br><br>He&#x2019;d managed to stay afloat, then, till the Ranger came over and started picking up survivors. That must have been a couple of hours. By the time he got rescued, he&#x2019;d kicked off all his clothes so he could tread water better. And every square inch of him that had been above the surface for even a little while was sunburned to a fare-thee-well. The sunburn would have troubled him worse than his little wounds if they hadn&#x2019;t had to put about a dozen stitches in the one on his ribcage. They&#x2019;d used novocaine when they sewed him up, but it had long since worn off.<br><br>The Japs had dive-bombed the Ranger, too, but the carrier, unlike the poor damned Boise, must have carried a rabbit&#x2019;s foot in her back pocket: all the bombs the Vals dropped missed, though none missed by much. She had some sprung seams, and blast and fragments had swept men from her flight deck. But she could still make full speed, and she still answered her helm. What more did you want&#x2014;egg in your beer?<br><br>From what the other wounded men in the sick bay said, right this minute the Ranger was making full speed back toward Hawaii. The little task force of which she&#x2019;d been the centerpiece had aimed to make life miserable for the Japs on some of the Pacific islands they held. What you aimed for and what you got, though, unfortunately weren&#x2019;t always the same critter.<br><br>A pharmacist&#x2019;s mate came through. Some of the guys in there were a lot worse off than Pete. Two or three of them, he feared, would go into the ocean shrouded in canvas, with a chunk of iron at their feet to make sure they didn&#x2019;t come up again.<br><br>&#x201c;How you doing, uh, McGrill?&#x201d; the pharmacist&#x2019;s mate asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Hurts,&#x201d; Pete said matter-of-factly. He knew more about pain than he&#x2019;d ever wanted to learn. On that scale, this wasn&#x2019;t so much of a much. But it did hurt. Without rancor, he added, &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s McGill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; The Navy file sounded more harassed than sorry, and who could blame him? He went on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll slather some more zinc oxide goop on where you cooked. You want a couple of codeine pills?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take &#x2019;em.&#x201d; Pete knew they&#x2019;d help a little, and also knew they&#x2019;d help only a little. As he had experience with pain, so he also had experience with pain medicine. He wasn&#x2019;t bad enough off to need morphine: nowhere near. They&#x2019;d want to save what they had for the poor, sorry bastards who really did need it.<br><br>&#x201c;Here you go, then. Can you sit up some?&#x201d;<br><br>Pete could, though moving made him hurt worse. He swallowed the pills, gulping all the water in the glass the pharmacist&#x2019;s mate handed him. He felt as if the salt water of the Pacific had sucked the moisture right out of him.<br><br>Whatever was in the ointment besides zinc oxide, it smelled medicinal and vaguely noxious. It soothed the skin on his cheeks and neck and shoulders and the top of his back. &#x201c;I wish you could rub it in my hair, too,&#x201d; Pete said. That was, of course, cut leatherneck short, so he had himself a sunburned scalp.<br><br>&#x201c;I will if you want me to,&#x201d; the pharmacist&#x2019;s mate said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nah. It&#x2019;d be too messy,&#x201d; Pete decided after a moment&#x2019;s thought. He asked, &#x201c;Can your scalp peel?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fuckin&#x2019; A it can,&#x201d; the Navy man said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen some bald guys who toasted their domes. It ain&#x2019;t pretty, man. Like dandruff, only more so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hot damn,&#x201d; Pete said resignedly. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve got something to look forward to, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Fraid so, McGrill.&#x201d; No, the pharmacist&#x2019;s mate hadn&#x2019;t been listening. And how big a surprise was that? He had bigger things to worry about than Pete&#x2019;s name. Off he went, briskly, to the guy in the next bed, who&#x2019;d lost a sizable chunk of meat from one buttock, and who&#x2019;d sleep on his stomach&#x2014;if he slept at all&#x2014;for the foreseeable future.<br><br>They got Pete out of the sick-bay bed a day later. Since he&#x2019;d come aboard the Ranger with not even the clothes on his back, they had to give him everything from skivvies on out. Nothing fit real well, and his shirt chafed his tender hide. But clothes make the man. Once he had on even these hand-me-downs, he felt like a Marine again.<br><br>Ranger&#x2019;s Marine detachment figured he was a leatherneck, too. They&#x2019;d lost a few men to the Japs&#x2019; near misses, and had several others worse off than Pete. He got to be low man on the five-inch-gun totem pole again, for the same reason as before: he was a new guy, and had no established place of his own. He didn&#x2019;t fret over it the way a more reflective man might have. It was useful duty, and duty he knew he could do.<br><br>His gun chief was a tobacco-chewing Okie sergeant named Bob Cullum. He had a narrow, ferrety face, cold blue eyes that seemed to look every which way at once, and hands with slim, almost unnaturally long fingers: a surgeon&#x2019;s fingers, or a fiddler&#x2019;s. He guided the dual-purpose gun with a delicacy and precision Joe Orsatti would have envied. Unless some other ship had plucked Joe out of the Pacific, he was dead. Pete hoped for the best there, but expected the worst.<br><br>Cullum&#x2019;s long, slim fingers had another talent, too. He could make a deck of cards sit up and beg. Since Pete came into the Ranger naked as the day he was born, that didn&#x2019;t matter much to him. Cullum said, &#x201c;Hey, if you want to play I can front you. If you end up losing it, pay me back when we get in to Pearl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, but I&#x2019;ll pass,&#x201d; Pete said. &#x201c;Never been much of a gambler, and I don&#x2019;t want to do it on borrowed money.&#x201d; That wasn&#x2019;t strictly true. He didn&#x2019;t add that Cullum seemed a little too eager, though. Anybody who could set the cards jitterbugging like that could probably make them behave in all kinds of interesting&#x2014;and profitable&#x2014;ways.<br><br>He must have sounded sincere, because the other sergeant didn&#x2019;t get mad. &#x201c;Well, maybe you ain&#x2019;t as dumb as you look, then,&#x201d; he said. His drawl and Pete&#x2019;s adenoidal Bronx accent were halfway toward being foreign languages to each other.<br><br>&#x201c;Up yours, too, Mac,&#x201d; Pete said. He didn&#x2019;t sound&#x2014;and wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;especially pissed off. But if Cullum wanted to make something of it, he was ready. Sometimes you had to go through crap like that when you found yourself in a new place. He figured Bob Cullum was faster than he was, but he had two inches and at least twenty pounds on the other leatherneck. Things evened out.<br><br>Cullum thought it over. Pete must have said it the right way, because he seemed willing to let it alone. &#x201c;And the horse you rode in on,&#x201d; he replied, also mildly. He eyed Pete. &#x201c;You look kinda like a raggedy-ass scarecrow, you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only things that fit are my shoes,&#x201d; Pete agreed. He spread his hands. &#x201c;Shit, what can you do, though?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me work on it,&#x201d; Cullum said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been on the Ranger since she was commissioned, and if I ain&#x2019;t the best scrounger aboard I dunno who the hell would be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Pete said, which committed him to nothing.<br><br>But Bob Cullum proved as good as his word. By the time the carrier did get to Hawaii, Pete had clothes that fit better than approximately. He had a wallet with five dollars in it. He had an obligation, too, and he knew it. When he and Cullum got some liberty, he&#x2019;d be doing the buying.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t mind. The other sergeant was plainly a guy with an eye for the main chance. If Cullum figured Pete might be connected to the main chance one way or another . . . What am I supposed to do? Pete thought. Hope the son of a bitch is wrong?<br><br>Hans-Ulrich Rudel&#x2019;s flying suit was made from fur and leather. No matter where you took off from, up above 5,000 meters the air was not only thin but far below freezing cold. In Russian winter, that flying suit came in handy when you were still down on terra firma. Rudel all but lived in it from first snowfall to spring&#x2019;s grudging arrival months later.<br><br>He sat in the cockpit of his Ju-87 at the end of a runway made by flattening out a long, narrow strip of wheatfield. The fall rains and the thick, gluey mud they brought were over. The ground under the Stuka&#x2019;s landing gear was frozen as hard as Stalin&#x2019;s heart.<br><br>He spoke into the voice tube: &#x201c;Radio behaving, Albert?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seems to be, sir,&#x201d; Sergeant Dieselhorst answered, voice brassy through the tube. Along with the radio, he was in charge of a rear-facing machine gun. Both he and Hans-Ulrich always hoped he didn&#x2019;t have to use it. The Stuka was a fine dive-bomber, but it had been in trouble against even the Czech biplane fighters it faced at the very beginning of the war. Fighters these days were a lot nastier&#x2014;although the Ivans still threw biplanes at the Luftwaffe. The Ivans, from everything Hans-Ulrich had seen, threw whatever they could get their hands on at their foes. If not all of it was top quality, it could still do some damage before it went down in flames. That was how they seemed to think, anyhow.<br><br>A groundcrew man yanked at the starting crank in front of the port wing. The crank was hard to move; another mechanic joined the first fellow in coveralls. The Junkers Jumo engine roared to life. Smoke and flame belched from the exhaust pipes. The prop blurred into invisibility. The groundcrew men carefully stepped away from the plane. If you weren&#x2019;t careful around a spinning prop, it could cost you your head&#x2014;literally. At least one groundcrew man had been shipped home from Russia in a coffin sealed tight because of a split second&#x2019;s inattention.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything look good, Herr Oberleutnant?&#x201d; Dieselhorst asked&#x2014;shouted, really, because the racket was terrific even inside the soundproofed cockpit. Outside . . . Like artillerymen, a lot of the Luftwaffe troops in the groundcrew wore earplugs to try to save some of their hearing.<br><br>Hans-Ulrich checked the instrument panel. &#x201c;All green, Albert,&#x201d; he answered, and gave the guys outside a thumbs-up to let them know the Stuka was ready to take off. They waved back.<br><br>The dive-bomber lumbered down the unpaved airstrip (as far as Rudel knew, there were no paved ones this side of Warsaw). When it reached takeoff speed, Hans-Ulrich hauled back on the stick, hard. The Stuka&#x2019;s nose came up. It sedately started to fly, rather like a fat old man doing a slow breaststroke across a public pool.<br><br>No Ju-87 ever made was or would be or could be a hot performer. All the same, Hans-Ulrich wished that particular comparison hadn&#x2019;t occurred to him. The weight and drag of the twin 37mm panzer-busting cannon under his wings only made his Stuka even more of a beast than it would have been anyhow. He&#x2019;d used guns like this pair to blast enemy panzers here and, earlier, in France. He&#x2019;d even knocked down a couple of fighters with them, more from desperation than tactical brilliance.<br><br>And he&#x2019;d been shot down twice, once in France and once here in Russia. He and Sergeant Dieselhorst had both managed to bail out twice, and hadn&#x2019;t hurt themselves too badly either time. No enemy pilot had machine-gunned them while they hung helpless under their big silk canopies, either. The Frenchman who&#x2019;d got Rudel&#x2019;s first Stuka must not have thought that was sporting. Victorious German pilots also didn&#x2019;t murder defenseless French flyers.<br><br>The Ivans . . . There were no guarantees with the Ivans, none at all. Hans-Ulrich knew how lucky they were not to have got perforated when the Russian pilot shot them down.<br><br>He spiraled slowly upwards. He wanted to gain altitude before he crossed the front and went hunting on the Soviet side. You couldn&#x2019;t die of old age waiting for your altimeter to unwind. It only seemed as if you could.<br><br>&#x201c;Three thousand meters,&#x201d; he said at last to Dieselhorst. &#x201c;Oxygen time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing it,&#x201d; the rear gunner/radioman answered. &#x201c;Delicious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s one word,&#x201d; Hans-Ulrich said with a laugh. Sucked in through a rubber hose, the bottled oxygen always reminded him of gnawing on a tire tread.<br><br>He flew north and east, in the general direction of Smolensk. If everything had gone the way the F�hrer and the General Staff wanted, the city would have fallen to the Wehrmacht before the fall rains slowed everyone&#x2019;s operations to a crawl. (Of course, if everything had gone the way the F�hrer and the General Staff wanted, Paris would have fallen to German blitzkrieg before winter 1939 turned to spring. You had to deal with what you got, not with what you wanted.)<br><br>Other Stukas droned on in the same general direction. They spread across the sky too loosely to be in anything worth dignifying by the name of formation. They had no set target. If someone spotted something that seemed worth going after down on the snowy ground, he&#x2019;d attack it. If not, he&#x2019;d keep going.<br><br>If someone spotted something. . . . The Russians had forgotten more about the art of camouflage than Germany knew. That was one of the reasons the hammer and sickle still flew above Smolensk: one of the reasons Smolensk still shielded Moscow from attack.

And when I pull up, give the train a burst from your machine gun, too,&#x201d; Hans-Ulrich said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a pleasure,&#x201d; the rear gunner replied.<br><br>Hans-Ulrich didn&#x2019;t have to stand the Stuka on its nose to attack the train. He came in at a shallow angle, flying slowly, and shot it up from back to front and from only a few meters above the cars. Then, as he&#x2019;d promised, he blasted the locomotive the way he was in the habit of shooting up enemy panzers through the thin engine decking that didn&#x2019;t do enough to protect them from attack from the air.<br><br>As he pulled back the stick to climb for another attack if he needed one, Dieselhorst did rake the train with a long burst from his MG-34. &#x201c;That engine&#x2019;s blowing steam like a whale,&#x201d; the sergeant reported. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t be able to keep going like that for long. . . .

This series is based on the true story of Ethan Cooper. Throughout the series, the children learn to trust God to help them with unexpected surprises.</p><p></p><h2>The Abernathy Boys</h2><p><p>Meet Bud Abernathy, age nine, and his brother, Temp, age five: two cowboys determined to see the Old West. The boys are headed for the Goodnight Ranch, where their daddy once was known as "Catch'em Alive" Jack for his ability to catch live wolves with his bare hands. To get to Goodnight, the brothers and their horses, Sam and Geronimo, will have to cross the caprock, a vast desert that is the loneliest place on earth. They're determined to do it -- and to do it alone.</p><p>Some would say that the story of the boys' journey is a mighty tall tale. But it's entirely true.</p></p><p><p>L.J. Hunt, who lives in Chicago, has a stepgrandfather with a 1908 Brush automobile. Though the old Brush can barely get to the bottom of the driveway these days, its existence led the author all the way to the Abernathy boys, who went for a long drive in one just like it one year after the journey described in this book. But that's another adventure, perhaps for another time.</p>Grade 4-6--Set in the early 20th century, this novel is based on the experiences of brothers Bud and Temple Abernathy. Bud has always dreamed about seeing the exotic places that his father describes in his stories. Although he is only nine years old, he carefully plots a route for him and his five-year-old brother to follow. With their daddy's permission and certain stipulations, the boys set out alone on horseback from their home in Oklahoma to travel through the Texas desert to Santa Fe, NM. During their trek, they encounter many dangers including quicksand, rattlesnakes, bad water, and mirages. They also meet kindhearted people who provide them with food and lodging. Ultimately, they are successful in their quest to visit all the locations on their itinerary and still return home in time for the beginning of the school year. The author uses dialect in the characters' conversations and includes historical figures, such as Theodore Roosevelt, to lend authenticity to the story. The boys' relationship develops from Temple's hero worship of his older brother to a truly close and loving friendship. Written with the matter-of-fact tone of a tall tale, the narrative provides glimpses of the old West and a way of life that is about to change forever. Filled with action and humor, it will appeal to reluctant readers as well as to those who are seeking stories of adventure and danger.<i>--Lana Miles, Duchesne Academy, Houston, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

YUMM.</p><p>Like a pop-cultural walk through time, <i>All-American Ads of the 40s</i> covers the breadth of print ads from the World War II era. As one might expect, the ads look very different from ads today. Most are illustrated, and even the selling of innocuous products like candy bars taps into public interest number one, the war. The book is divided into chapters by product including alcohol, fashion, entertainment, travel, and automobiles. Saving the best for last, the conclusion of each chapter reveals the editor's pick for most peculiar ad. Most enticing are the movie posters. Classic pictures like <i>Citizen Kane</i> and <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> appear in their original print incarnations as fantastic visions of old Hollywood. Hawking beauty products are famous stars such as Lucille Ball, Lana Turner, Marlene Dietrich, and Veronica Lake. Not surprisingly, gender roles are sharply divided, and race issues stick out sorely.

Howard Series, Vol II)</h2><p>Banished from his home world, the warrior Kull becomes the king of the advanced Valusia empire and is challenged to defend his crown against treacherous nobles, a race of serpent-men, and the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom. Original.</p><p>As some cover blurbs so rightly state, "Before Conan--there was Kull!" The warrior Kull was yet another popular creation of pulp writer Robert E. Howard (1906-1936), generally credited as the originator of the subgenre heroic fantasy. Yet Kull should not be dismissed as second-rate Conan. (Although Howard did transform a few unsold Kull adventures into those of Conan the Cimmerian when the later series took off with the public.) Set in ancient, lost Atlantis, the Kull stories take place mostly after the barbarian has already come to power as King Kull of Valusia. What makes these scant dozen stories most memorable is Howard's heightened style of mystical decadence, similar here to his <i>Weird Tales</i> contemporary, Clark Ashton Smith. Rest assured there's enough gruesome bloodletting and wanton savagery to satisfy the most ardent Howard reader. (Variant editions of this collection have been published over the years, with the uncompleted stories finished posthumously by Lin Carter. Other editions have simply presented the few story fragments as untouched--and unadulterated--Robert E. Howard.) <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>Robert E. Howard (1906-36) lived and wrote in Cross Plains, Texas. From 1924 until his death, he sold hundreds of stories to pulp-fiction magazines such as &#34;Weird Tales,&#34; &#34;Argosy,&#34; &#34;Action Stories,&#34; &#34;Fight Stories,&#34; and &#34;Cowboy Stories,&#34; As a twentieth-century American master of fantastic adventure, he rivals Edgar Rice Burroughs. Rusty Burke is a noted Howard scholar and collector and is the series editor for the Wandering Star edition of Howard&#39;s works. Patrice Louinet is a teacher in Meudon, France. He is the editor of &#34;Robert E.

His poetry holds a mirror to the secret, capricious world of Henry VIII's court, and alludes darkly to events which it might be death to describe. In the Tower, twice, Wyatt was betrayed and betrayer.<br> <br>Thought to be the lover of Anne Boleyn, he was also the devoted 'slave' of Katherine of Aragon. He was driven to secrets and lies, and forced to live with the moral and mortal consequences of his shifting allegiances. As ambassador to Emperor Charles V, he enjoyed favour, but his embassy turned to nightmare when the Pope called for a crusade against the English King and sent the Inquisition against Wyatt. At Henry VIII's court, where only silence brought safety, Wyatt played the idealized lover, but also tried to speak truth to power.<br> <br>Wyatt's life provides a way to examine the Renaissance and Reformation in England. Above all, this new biography is attuned to Wyatt's voice, the paradox within him of inwardness and the will to 'make plain' his heart, which make him exceptionally difficult to know - and fascinating to explore.</p><p>Susan Brigden, Fellow and Tutor of Lincoln College and Reader in the University of Oxford, is author of <i>London and the Reformation</i> (Oxford, 1989) and <i>New Worlds, Lost Worlds: The Rule of the Tudors</i> <i>1485-1603</i> (Penguin Press, 2000).</p><h2>Sacred Art</h2><p>Discusses the nature of sacred art and shares the author&#39;s experiences in commissioning works for the churches of Assy, Vence, Audincourt, and Ronchamp</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Paper Bag Princess (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition) (Munsch for Kids)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Just when she is about to marry Prince Ronald, a dragon smashes her castle, burns her clothes with his fiery breath, and prince-naps her dear Ronald. Undaunted and presumably unclad, she dons a large paper bag and sets off to find the dragon and her cherished prince. Once she's tracked down the rascally reptile, she flatters him into performing all sorts of dragonly stunts that eventually exhaust him, allowing her to rescue Prince Ronald. But what does Prince Not-So-Charming say when he sees her? "You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess." (At least he has the courtesy not to mention that the princess's crown resembles a dying sea anemone.) In any case, let's just say that Princess Elizabeth and Prince Ronald do not, under any circumstances, live happily ever after.

In this collection of personal and revealing essays, he explores the nature of his anthropological work in relation to a broader public, serving as the foremost spokesperson of his generation of scholars, those who came of age after World War II. His reflections are written in a style that both entertains and disconcerts, as they engage us in topics ranging from moral relativism to the relationship between cultural and psychological differences, from the diversity and tension among activist faiths to "ethnic conflict" in today's politics.</p><br><p> Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism. <i>Available Light</i> offers insightful discussions of concepts such as nation, identity, country, and self, with a reminder that like symbols in general, their meanings are not categorically fixed but grow and change through time and place.</p><br><p> This book treats the reader to an analysis of the American intellectual climate by someone who did much to shape it. One can read Available Light both for its revelation of public culture in its dynamic, evolving forms and for the story it tells about the remarkable adventures of an innovator during the "golden years" of American academia.</p></p><p><b>Clifford Geertz</b> published his famous work, <i>The Interpretation of Cultures</i>, in 1973.

Miss Mary is a perky young lady who primps at a pink-skirted vanity table while a newspaper touts "Elephant escapes zoo." The additional verses tell a fuller story of Miss Mary, recounting the elephant's exploits after he jumps the fence and lands in a yard filled with Fourth of July picnickers, and the friendship that ensues between him and the girl. The elephant takes more of center stage with each successive illustration, whether he is soaring through the air, his adroitness belying his size, or landing in a yard, creating an elephant-sized craterAand mess. When the zookeeper finally arrives to retrieve him, Mary begs him to stay, even offering him her silver buttons that soon are no longer down her back but on his trunk. By the end of the story, both Mary and the elephant vault over the fence for 50 cents.

Tippit</h2><p>An exhaustive examination of the murder of a Dallas policeman 45 minutes after JFK was shot. The author, a journalist, puts together what he calls a &#34;second-by-second account&#34; of the day of the murder, addressing questions such as whether Tippit was a co-conspirator, how Oswald and Tippit happened to meet shortly after the assassination, whether the two men knew Jack Ruby, and if it was really Oswald who shot Tippit. Included are 150-plus photographs, 16 color plates, and 182 documents such as arrest and autopsy reports and other internal police department reports. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>The assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the events that surround it have been examined and dissected like no other event in American history. Yet the shooting of J.D. Tippit remains one of the most overlooked, misunderstood - and often twisted - aspects of this horrific crime. Perhaps, that is why I was drawn to the murder of this Dallas Patrolman. <p>For more than twenty years, I sifted through documents and testimony in an attempt to piece together the truth about Tippit's murder. Although the story they told was fascinating, I soon found the 'human element' the key to unraveling many of the myths and rumors that have sprung up around this case. Interviewing many of those involved in this story was an unexpected eye-opener. Their recollections flushed out many of the details that have puzzled students of the assassination over the years. Their stories put a human face on the Tippit drama, and supplied emotion where cold fact had once stood guard. In an effort to capture at least some of this essential human ingredient, much of the dialogue and memories in this book are verbatim from transcripts, testimony, and recollections. This is their story, in their own words. </p><p>Most of the mystery that shrouds the Kennedy assassination has been unwittingly preserved by a populace unable or unwilling to look for the answers. The fact that the official record remains scattered in government files around the country has not made it easy to challenge what has been written in the past. Yet, the truth is there, waiting to be discovered. Some mysteries remain, of course. That's to be expected in a case that has lain forgotten and neglected for more than three decades. Because many of the participants are now deceased, including several interviewed for this book, there are some answers that are destined to remain elusive. Still, the picture that emerges from this weave of human recollection is remarkably clear and consistent. More than anything, it is the ease with which these multiple perspectives mesh together that feels the most like truth. </p><p>In many ways, this book represents the investigation that Oswald's own untimely death cut short.</p>A second-by-second account of the murder of Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit - killed forty-five minutes after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy - and the frantic manhunt that ended in the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald. <p>157 photographs in text<br> 16 color plates<br> 13 maps and illustrations<br> 182 documents<br> Over 1,000 reference notes<br> </p><p>I still wonder what would have been the consequences for Dallas had Oswald escaped? Until author Dale Myers so painstakingly retraced the event, the person I consider a national hero, Officer Tippit, had remained largely a faceless player in the JFK assassination cast. Yet Tippit's showdown with Oswald had a momentous impact on the outcome. Thanks to Myers, maybe history will remember the price Tippit paid in the performance of duty in 1963. (James Ewell, former <i>Dallas Morning News</i> reporter) </p><p>...a fascinating web of fact vs. fantasy, of the frantic confusion that began with the shots that killed the President on November 22, 1963...Thirty-five years later, Myers has wrapped up the story. His answers make sense. They're supported by pillars of fact and analysis. They should stand. (Robert H. Johnson, Associated Press (Ret.))</p></p><h2>Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision (Large Print 16pt)</h2><p>One of the most important African American leaders of the twentieth century and perhaps the most influential woman in the civil rights movement, Ella Baker (1903-1986) was an activist whose remarkable career spanned fifty years and touched thousands of lives. A gifted grassroots organizer, Baker shunned the spotlight in favor of vital behind-the-scenes work that helped power the black freedom struggle. She was a national officer and key figure in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, one of the founders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and a prime mover in the creation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Baker made a place for herself in predominantly male political circles that included W. E. B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, and Martin Luther King Jr., all the while maintaining relationships with a vibrant group of women, students, and activists both black and white. In this deeply researched biography, Barbara Ransby chronicles Baker&#39;s long and rich political career as an organizer, an intellectual, and a teacher, from her early experiences in depression-era Harlem to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Ransby shows Baker to be a complex figure whose radical, democratic worldview, commitment to empowering the black poor, and emphasis on group-centered, grassroots leadership set her apart from most of her political contemporaries. Beyond documenting an extraordinary life, the book paints a vivid picture of the African American fight for justice and its intersections with other progressive struggles worldwide across the twentieth century. This edition is in two volumes. The second volume ISBN is 9781459658042.</p><p>An award-winning biography of Ella Baker (1903-1986), one of the most important African American leaders of the twentieth century and perhaps the most influential woman in the civil rights movement.

In a remarkable work of interpretive history, Fergus Millar shows us this world as it was forged into the Roman provinces of Syria, Judaea, Arabia, and Mesopotamia. His book conveys the magnificent sweep of history as well as the rich diversity of peoples, religions, and languages that intermingle in the Roman Near East. Against this complex backdrop, Millar explores questions of cultural and religious identity and ethnicity--as aspects of daily life in the classical world and as part of the larger issues they raise. </p><p> As Millar traces the advance of Roman control, he gives a lucid picture of Rome's policies and governance over its far-flung empire. He introduces us to major regions of the area and their contrasting communities, bringing out the different strands of culture, communal identity, language, and religious belief in each. <i>The Roman Near East</i> makes it possible to see rabbinic Judaism, early Christianity, and eventually the origins of Islam against the matrix of societies in which they were formed. Millar's evidence permits us to assess whether the Near East is best seen as a regional variant of Graeco-Roman culture or as in some true sense oriental. </p><p> A masterful treatment of a complex period and world, distilling a vast amount of literary, documentary, artistic, and archaeological evidence--always reflecting new findings--this book is sure to become the standard source for anyone interested in the Roman Empire or the history of the Near East. </p></p><p><b>Fergus G. B. Millar</b> is Camden Professor of Ancient History at Oxford University.This pioneering volume follows a steady stream of other important contributions by the noted Camden Professor of Ancient History at Oxford, but its unique character and subject may make it his most durable and popular work. It transcends a mere political history of the region by exploring in depth the cultural and linguistic diversity of the population that inhabited the Near East...This is indisputably now the standard and essential guide for the Roman era in English for both scholars and students of the Near East.<br> --David E. Graf (<i>Religious Studies Review</i>)<br><br>A grand book on a grand topic...To do justice to such a topic, one needs not only a complete understanding of how the Roman Empire functioned, but also mastery of the extensive, complex, scattered, and difficult evidence for the local cultures...Very few ancient historians possess such mastery...This is a book that only Fergus Millar could have written. The breadth of expertise displayed, and the willingness to view the history of a major region of the Roman Empire from the perspective of the provinces rather than the imperial center, are hallmarks of Millar's work, and are impossible to overpraise. There can be no question that <i>The Roman Near East</i> will be for a long time to come the standard work on the subject.<br> --Seth Schwartz (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>This learned, honest, and carefully constructed work studies the various regions of the [eastern] empire and their inhabitants.

Hansen&nbsp;is a professor of history at Auburn University. A former historian for NASA, Hansen is the author of ten books on the history of aerospace, including <i>First Man</i>. He lives in Auburn, Alabama.<b>Prologue: The Launch</b><p>After the Moon mission was over and the Apollo 11 astronauts were back on Earth, Buzz Aldrin remarked to Neil Armstrong, "Neil, we missed the whole thing."</p><p>Somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million people, the largest crowd ever for a space launch, gathered at Florida's Cape Kennedy in the days leading to Wednesday, July 16, 1969. Nearly a thousand policemen, state troopers, and waterborne state conservation patrolmen struggled through the previous night to keep an estimated 350,000 cars and boats flowing on the roads and waterways. One enterprising state auto inspector leased two miles of roadside from orange growers, charging two bucks a head for viewing privileges. For $1.50 apiece, another entrepreneur sold pseudo-parchment attendance certificates with simulated Old English lettering; an additional $2.95 bought a pseudo space pen.</p><p>No tailgate party at any Southeastern Conference football game could match the summer festival preceding the first launch for a Moon landing. Sunglassed spectators dressed in Bermuda shorts or undressed in bikinis, even at this early hour firing up barbecue grills, opening coolers of beer and soda pop, peering through binoculars and telescopes, testing camera angles and lenses -- people filled every strand of sand, every oil-streaked pier, every fish-smelling jetty.</p><p>Sweltering in 90-degree heat by midmorning, bitten up by mosquitoes, still aggravated by traffic jams or premium tourist prices, the great mass of humanity waited patiently for the mammoth Saturn V to shoot Apollo 11 toward the Moon.</p><p>In the Banana River, five miles south of the launch complex, all manner of boats choked the watercourse. Companies such as Grumman Aircraft had hired the larger charters for the day to give their employees a chance to witness the product of their years of effort. Aboard a large cabin cruiser, the <i>Grapefruit II,</i> wealthy citrus grower George Lier of Orchid Island, Florida, playfully tossed grapefruit at passersby. Just offshore, two small African-American boys sat in a ramshackle rowboat casually watching the mayhem that was making it so hard to catch any fish.</p><p>On a big motor cruiser owned by North American Aviation, builder of the Apollo command module, Janet Armstrong, the wife of Apollo 11's commander, and her two boys, twelve-year-old Rick and six-year-old Mark, stood nervously awaiting the launch. Fellow astronaut Dave Scott, Neil's mate on the Gemini VIII flight in 1966, had arranged what Janet called a "numero uno spot." Besides Scott, two of Janet's friends -- Pat Spann, a neighbor from El Lago, Texas, whose husband worked in the Manned Spacecraft Center's Mission Support Office, and Jeanette Chase, who helped Janet coach the synchronized swimming team at the El Lago Keys Club and whose husband served in the Recovery Division at MSC -- were also on board, as were a few NASA public affairs officers and Dora Jane (Dodie) Hamblin, a journalist with exclusive coverage of the personal side of the Apollo 11 story for <i>Life</i> magazine.</p><p>Above them all, helicopters ferried successive groups of VIPs to reserved bleacher seating in the closest viewing stands a little more than three miles away from the launchpad. Of the nearly 20,000 on NASA's special guest list, about one-third actually attended, including a few hundred foreign ministers, ministers of science, military attaches, and aviation officials, as well as nineteen U.S. state governors, forty mayors, and a few hundred leaders of American business and industry. Half the members of Congress were in attendance, as were a couple of Supreme Court justices. The guest list ranged from General William Westmoreland, the U.S. army chief of staff in charge of the war in Vietnam, and Johnny Carson, the star of NBC's <i>Tonight Show,</i> to Leon Schachter, head of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers, and Prince Napoleon of Paris, a direct descendant of the emperor Napoleon.</p><p>Vice President Spiro T. Agnew sat in the bleachers while President Richard M. Nixon watched on TV from the Oval Office. Originally, the White House had planned for Nixon to dine with the Apollo 11 astronauts the night before liftoff, but the plan changed after Dr. Charles Berry, the astronauts' chief physician, was quoted in the press warning that there was always a chance that the president might unknowingly be harboring an incipient cold. Armstrong, Aldrin, and the third member of their crew, Mike Collins, thought the medical concern was absurd; if the truth be known, twenty or thirty people -- secretaries, space suit technicians, simulator technicians -- were coming into daily contact. Apollo 8's Frank Borman, whom NASA had designated as Nixon's special space consultant, assailed Berry's warning as "totally ridiculous" and "damned stupid" but stopped short of arguing for another reversal of plans, "because if anyone sneezes on the Moon, they'd put the blame on the president."</p><p>Two thousand credentialed reporters watched the launch from the Kennedy Space Center press site. Eight hundred and twelve came from foreign countries, 111 from Japan alone. A dozen journalists came from the Soviet bloc: seven from Czechoslovakia, three from Yugoslavia, and two from Romania.</p><p>Landing on the Moon was a shared global event which nearly all humankind felt transcended politics. British papers used two- and three-inch high type to herald news of the launch. In Spain, the <i>Evening Daily Pueblo,</i> though critical of American foreign policy, sent twenty-five contest winners on an all-expense-paid trip to Cape Kennedy. A Dutch editorialist called his country "lunar-crazy." A Czech commentator remarked, "This is the America we love, one so totally different from the America that fights in Vietnam." The popular German paper <i>Bild Zeitung</i> noted that seven of the fifty-seven Apollo supervisors were of German origin; the paper chauvinistically concluded, "12 percent of the entire Moon output is 'made in Germany.' " Even the French considered Apollo 11 "the greatest adventure in the history of humanity." <i>France-Soir's</i> twenty-two-page supplement sold 1.5 million copies. A French journalist marveled that interest in the Moon landing was running so high "in a country whose people are so tired of politics and world affairs that they are accused of caring only about vacations and sex."</p><p>Moscow Radio led its broadcast with news of the launch. <i>Pravda</i> rated the scene at Cape Kennedy front-page news, captioning a picture of the Apollo 11 crew "these three courageous men."</p><p>Not all the press was favorable. Out of Hong Kong, three Communist newspapers attacked the mission as a cover-up for the American failure to win the Vietnam War and charged that the Moon landing was an effort to "extend imperialism into space."</p><p>Others charged that the materialism of the American space program would forever ruin the wonder and beautiful ethereal qualities of the mysterious Moon, enveloped from time immemorial in legend. After human explorers violated the Moon with footprints and digging tools, who again could ever find romance in poet John Keats's question, "What is there in thee, moon, that thou shouldst move my heart so potently?"</p><p>Partaking of the technological miracle of the first telecommunications satellites launched earlier in the decade, at the U.S. embassy in Seoul, 50,000 South Koreans gathered before a wall-sized television screen. A crowd of Poles filled the auditorium at the American embassy in Warsaw. Trouble with AT&amp;T's Intelsat III satellite over the Atlantic prevented a live telecast in Brazil (as it did in many parts of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean region), but Brazilians listened to accounts on radio and bought out special newspaper editions. Because of the Intelsat problem, a makeshift, round-the-world, west-to-east transmission caused a two-second lag in live coverage worldwide.</p><p>Shortly before liftoff, CBS News commentator Eric Sevareid, who at age sixty-six was seeing his first manned shot, described the scene to Walter Cronkite's television audience: "Walter...as we sit here today...I think the [English] language is being altered.... How do you say 'high as the sky' anymore, or 'the sky is the limit' -- what does that mean?"</p><p>Nowhere on the globe was the excitement as palpable as it was throughout the United States. In east Tennessee, tobacco farmers picking small pink flowers from tobacco plants crowded around a pocket-size transistor in order to share the big moment. In the harbor at Biloxi, Mississippi, shrimpers waited on the wharf for word that Apollo 11 had lifted off. At the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, where 7:30 a.m. classes were postponed, fifty cadets hovered around one small TV set. "Everybody held his breath," a twenty-year-old senior cadet from Missouri said. "Then, as the spaceship lifted off the ground, we began to cheer and clap and yell and scream." In the twenty-four-hour casino at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the blackjack and roulette tables sat empty while gamblers stood spellbound in front of six television sets.</p><p>The multitude of eyewitnesses assembled on and around the Cape, Merritt Island, Titusville, Indian River, Cocoa Beach, Satellite Beach, Melbourne, throughout Brevard and Osceola counties, as far away as Daytona Beach and Orlando, prepared to behold one of the most awesome sights known to man, second only perhaps to the detonation of an atomic bomb.</p><p>William Nelson, an engineering planner from Durham, Connecticut, sat with his family of seven and, gazing at the Apollo rocket looming eleven miles away, said excitedly, "They tell me I'll be able to feel the earth shake when it goes off. Once I see it, I'll know that it was worth all the heat and mosquitoes. All I know is that my kids will be able to say they were here." The voice of Jacksonville, Florida's Mrs. John Yow, wife of a stockbroker, quivered as she uttered, "I'm shaky, I'm tearful. It's the beginning of a new era in the life of man." Charles Walker, a student from Armstrong's own Purdue University, told a newsman from his campsite on a small inlet in Titusville, "It's like mankind has developed ...</p></p><h2>Rosario+Vampire, Vol. 1</h2><p>Tsukune's going to have one heck of a hickey when he gets home from Monster High!<br><br>All-around average teenager Tsukune can't get accepted to any high school save one...but on his first day he finds the rest of the student body doesn't appear average at all.

In the city she is made to confront aspects of living she has, until now, avoided, and to consider questions of vulnerability and power, death and renewal, in what becomes her struggle to reattach herself to, and believe in, life.</p><p>Filtered through the impersonal gaze of its keenly intelligent protagonist, <em>Transit</em> sees Rachel Cusk delve deeper into the themes first raised in her critically acclaimed novel <em>Outline</em>, and offers up a penetrating and moving reflection on childhood and fate, the value of suffering, the moral problems of personal responsibility, and the mystery of change. In this precise, short, and yet epic novel, Cusk manages to describe the most elemental experiences, the liminal qualities of life, through a narrative near-silence that draws language towards it. She captures with unsettling restraint and honesty the longing to both inhabit and flee one&#x2019;s life and the wrenching ambivalence animating our desire to feel real.</p><p><strong>Rachel Cusk</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed trilogy of <em>Outline, Transit </em>and <em>Kudos</em>.

And Harriet finds herself ensnared in a nightmare of romance and terror, with only the tiniest shreds of clues to challenge her powers of detection, and those of her paramour, Lord Peter Wimsey.</p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages. As well as her popular Lord Peter Wimsey series, she wrote several religious plays, but considered her translations of Dante's <i>Divina Commedia</i> to be her best work.<br><br>GAUDY NIGHT is one of Sayers's most famous mysteries, and narrator Ian Carmichael does a splendid job personifying each of its well-drawn characters. The plot offers a lot of activity and even more dialogue, which Carmichael enhances with his gorgeous delivery. When Harriet Vane returns to her alma mater, Oxford, she finds herself in the middle of an escalating campaign of hatred. She calls Lord Peter Wimsey to assist as the attacks become physical, putting everyone in danger. Carmichael beautifully handles the eminently quotable Wimsey, along with a great deal of emotion, a suicidal young student, and the scouts (servants) who are vital to the story. He even treats listeners to a moving duet performed by Peter and Harriet in a lighter moment. A wonderful choice, even for those who are already familiar with the great Dorothy L. Sayers. S.G.B. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Divinity &amp; Diversity: A Christian Affirmation of Religious Pluralism</h2><p>One of today&#39;s foremost theologians presents the case for embracing religious pluralism as integral to the Christian gospel. Religious pluralism is a fact in North American society today. More than at any other time, adherents of different religious traditions live, work, and play side by side. Yet the fact of religious pluralism creates a tension for a large number of Christians. At the same time they have realized that Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and members of many other religious groups have become their neighbors, they are also aware of Christian teachings that seem to exclude these groups. Statements such as &#34;no one comes to the Father except through me&#34; and &#34;outside the church there is no salvation&#34; seem to imply that these new neighbors are not part of the family of God, or at least that their religious beliefs and practices are not viable avenues to human wholeness and salvation. In this insightful and irenic work, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki demonstrates that Christians need not ignore, nor even compromise, the teachings of the gospel in order to accept and rejoice in religious pluralism. She argues that the Christian doctrines of creation, incarnation, the image of God, and the reign of God make the diversity of religions necessary. Without such diversity the rich and deep community of humanity that is the goal of the Christian gospel cannot be realized. Along the way Suchocki rejects the exclusivist claim that there can be no relationship with God apart from the church, and the inclusivist idea that Christianity is the highest expression of the search for God, with other religions possessing in part that which Christians possess in full. She argues instead for a pluralist position, insisting on a full recognition of the distinctive gifts that all of the religious traditions bring to the human table.</p><p>Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, Ph.D., is Professor Emerita, Claremont School of Theology<br> <br> home address:&nbsp;1332 N NORTH HILLS DR., UPLAND, CA 91784-1762</p><h2>Captive Queen: A Novel of Eleanor of Aquitaine</h2><p>Having proven herself a gifted and engaging novelist with her portrayals of Queen Elizabeth I in The Lady Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey in Innocent Traitor, New York Times bestselling author Alison Weir now harks back to the twelfth century with a sensuous and tempestuous tale that brings vividly to life England&#x2019;s most passionate&#x2014;and destructive&#x2014;royal couple: Eleanor of Aquitaine and King Henry II.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Nearing her thirtieth birthday, Eleanor has spent the past dozen frustrating years as consort to the pious King Louis VII of France.

The union of this royal couple will create a vast empire that stretches from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees, and marks the beginning of the celebrated Plantagenet dynasty.<br><br>But Henry and Eleanor&#x2019;s marriage, charged with physical heat, begins a fiery downward spiral marred by power struggles, betrayals, bitter rivalries, and a devil&#x2019;s brood of young Plantagenets&#x2014;including Richard the Lionheart and the future King John. Early on, Eleanor must endure Henry&#x2019;s formidable mother, the Empress Matilda, as well as his infidelities, while in later years, Henry&#x2019;s friendship with Thomas Becket will lead to a deadly rivalry. Eventually, as the couple&#x2019;s rebellious sons grow impatient for power, the scene is set for a vicious and tragic conflict that will engulf both Eleanor and Henry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Vivid in detail, epic in scope, <b>Captive Queen </b>is an astounding and brilliantly wrought historical novel that encompasses the building of an empire and the monumental story of a royal marriage.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Interesting Facts About Eleanor of Aquitaine, from Alison Weir</strong> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204) is arguably the most important and admired female figure in medieval European history.</li> <li><em>Captive Queen</em> tells the epic and dramatic tale of this strong and remarkable woman who held her own in a male-dominated world. </li> <li>Eleanor was queen first to Louis VII of France and then to Henry II of England.</li> <li>Her lands comprised half of what is now France, making her the greatest heiress in Europe. The transfer of that landed inheritance, first to France and then to England, set the pattern of European diplomacy and warfare for the next four centuries.</li> <li>Her marriage to Henry II of England, which is the focus of <em>Captive Queen</em>, was one of the most passionate and tempestuous in history. Both Eleanor and Henry were larger-than-life, charismatic characters.</li> <li>Eleanor was a true daughter of the south of France, raised in a society in which women were valued more highly than elsewhere, and morals were lax. She grew up imbued with the culture and poetry of the troubadours, and her beauty was famous.</li> <li>Eleanor&#x2019;s reputation was notorious, in her own lifetime and increasingly thereafter. She was a sensual woman with little regard for the moral precepts of her day, and she had adulterous affairs with several men, including her uncle and her future father-in-law. </li> <li>Many of the romantic or sinister legends that have attached themselves to Eleanor&#x2019;s name center upon her rival, Henry&#x2019;s mistress, Rosamund de Clifford. In this novel, Alison Weir has made creative use of those legends.</li> <li>Eleanor bore eleven children&#x2014;among them Richard the Lion Heart, renowned as the greatest crusader in Christendom, and the notorious King John, who was forced to sign the Magna Carta.</li> <li>The book&#x2019;s title derives from the fact that Eleanor was a captive in her marriage, loving and hating Henry at the same time. Later on, having dealt him a bitter betrayal, she would become his captive in very truth.</li> <li>Ultimately, <em>Captive Queen</em> is a searing psychological odyssey, an intense exploration of the character and motives of an extraordinary woman.</li></ul>Alison Weir is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the novels<b> Innocent Traitor</b> and <b>The Lady Elizabeth</b> and several historical biographies, including <b>Mistress of the Monarchy, Queen Isabella, Henry VIII, Eleanor of Aquitaine, The Life of Elizabeth I</b>, and <b>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</b>.

Now, with over thirty thousand copies sold and in a fully updated, revised, and expanded edition, Lefty Kreh has yet again brought his classic work up-to-date. In clear, practical terms and helpful photographs and line drawings, Fly Fishing in Salt Water treats the techniques needed to catch all the major saltwater species - bonefish, tarpon, striped bass, bluefish, salmon, permit, snook, sharks, cobia, tuna, billfish, and more. The book shows how to fish from boats and how to wade the flats, and fully explains all the tackle needed and how to use it for specific jobs - the rods, the lines and leaders, and the flies (shown in full color). Lefty provides superb advice about how to make the long casts necessary for fishing the fly in salt water, how to "tease" sailfish and other large fish to within fly-casting range, how to chum, and how to tie the necessary knots for saltwater fishing. New chapters include Knots and Leaders, Flies, Tackle, Inshore Fly Fishing, and Boats. Fly Fishing in Salt Water is based on firsthand experience by an acknowledged master. It is the saltwater fly fisher's bible. (7 1/4 X 9 1/2, 344 pages, color photos, b&amp;w photos, diagrams, charts)</p><p>For the subspecies of saltwater angler who insists on doing his fishing with flies, Kreh is the guru and this is the holy book. Now in its third revised edition, <i>Fly Fishing in Salt Water</i> first surfaced in the late '60s when the idea of fishing the seas with a fly for bluefish, stripers, bonito, and bigger game like tarpon and tuna was not only novel, it was sneered at. Fly-fishing in saltwater is still a relatively new frontier, but time has proven Kreh a visionary and the virtual father of the sport, and this how-to remains an essential part of a saltwater fly-angler's tackle. <p> Why fish salt water with a fly? Because, says Kreh, it combines the best physical and cerebral aspects of fishing <i>and</i> hunting, with the added complication that "no stocked fish roam the seas." Unlike trout fishing ("Trout fishing writers have always tended to complicate a rather simple sport," carps Kreh), where the angler must understand from the start that trout in a pool are relatively stationary creatures that exist only on the food available in that pool, saltwater species are fish in transit, constantly on the move, often in schools, and they gulp down anything they run into. Kreh's bible begins by engraving that difference in stone. Then it patiently introduces you to the sport's basics step by step: the necessary tackle and how to care for it; technique; fly patterns; fish behavior; the long cast; understanding tides and where fish are likely located; and specifics of deepwater fishing, inshore fishing, and fishing at sea from boats. </p><p> "The sea has always been a fascination to me, and the creatures in it offer the greatest challenge a fly rodder will ever know," writes Kreh. His unparalleled infectious enthusiasm--just look at the cover photo of the author: a happy man if ever there was one--and expertise make that challenge as reachable as it is alluring. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p></p><h2>311 Pelican Court (Cedar Cove, Book 3)</h2><p>A captivating novel visits the small town of Cedar Cove, Washington, where an unforgettable cast of characters, including Rosie and Jack Cox who must come to terms with their divorce, as well as their unusual custody arrangement, learn the true meaning of love, family, and community. Original.</p><p><b>Debbie Macomber </b>is one of today&#x2019;s leading voices in women&#x2019;s fiction. A regular on every major bestseller list with more than 140 million copies of her books in print, Debbie&#x2019;s popularity is worldwide with her books translated into twenty-three languages. Debbie and her husband,Wayne, are the proud parents of four children and grandparents of eight grandchildren. They live in Washington State and winter in Florida.<br><br>From the moment Rosie Cox entered Cedar Cove's divorce court, she'd felt a renewed sense of failure&#x2014;not to mention betrayal. Who <em>wouldn't</em> feel that way? After seventeen years of what she'd believed to be a reasonably good marriage, Zach's infidelity was the last thing she'd expected.<br><br>He'd never openly admitted to the affair. She hadn't found her husband in a compromising situation, hadn't found any concrete evidence&#x2014;no matchbooks from expensive restaurants, no jewelry receipts or motel bills&#x2014;but in her heart she knew. A wife always does.<br><br>Rosie owned up to the truth&#x2014;she was angry and she'd expressed that anger by making this divorce as complicated and difficult as she possibly could. Why should she go easy on Zach or walk away from their marriage without one hell of a fight? And fight she had, with both fists raised.<br><br>As she turned away from the judge, the final decree in her hand, she realized she'd made another mistake.<br><br>Rosie had <em>assumed</em> that once the divorce was granted, the anger and bitterness of these dreadful months would be lifted.<br><br>Wrong again. An even heavier burden had been added. When the joint custody agreement she and Zach had so carefully worked out, point by point, was presented to Judge Olivia Lockhart, the judge had rejected it.<br><br>Instead, Judge Lockhart had stated that it was emotionally detrimental to kids to shuffle them between residences every few days. Allison and Eddie needed stable lives, according to Judge Lockhart, and <em>they</em> hadn't asked for the divorce. Some people considered the judge innovative, Rosie thought, disgruntled. How about interfering? Or out of her mind? Because&#x2014;of all the crazy settlements&#x2014;she'd awarded the children their house. That meant Rosie and Zach would be the ones moving in and out.<br><br>Talk about ridiculous! Talk about impossible.<br><br>Now that the divorce was final, Rosie and Zach would have to figure out some kind of living arrangements. The ramifications of what they'd agreed to were starting to hit Rosie and she hadn't even left the courtroom.<br><br>"Rosie," Sharon Castor, her attorney, said as soon as they were in the silent hallway outside the courtroom. "We have to meet with your ex-husband."<br><br>One look told Rosie that Sharon was as flustered as she was herself.<br><br>Otto Benson, Zach's lawyer, joined them. Although he remained outwardly calm, his face was tense. She dared not glance in Zach's direction. In fact, she'd avoided looking at her ex-husband from the moment she'd walked into the courtroom.<br><br>"Let's get a conference room and discuss the details," Zach's attorney said.<br><br>Rosie peered at Zach, standing behind his lawyer. He didn't seem any happier than she was with this decision, but she'd keel over in a dead faint before she let him know how she felt.<br><br>"Rosie and I should be able to work this out ourselves," Zach said with an edge of irritation.<br><br>Given the way everything had gone so far, that suggestion wasn't promising. "If you remember, it took us weeks of haggling to come up with this joint custody agreement," she pointed out. She enjoyed reminding him what a jerk he'd been. Rosie supposed Zach was hoping to avoid more attorneys' fees. Too bad. If he ended up with less money to spend on his girlfriend, that wasn't her concern.<br><br>Fists clenched, Zach snarled something under his breath. Probably just as well she couldn't hear it, Rosie decided, proud of her own display of self-control.<br><br>"What makes you think we're capable of agreeing to anything without a mediator?" she asked sarcastically.<br><br>"Fine," Zach muttered, with a pout reminiscent of their nine-year-old son. Staring at him now, Rosie had trouble believing she'd ever loved Zachary Cox. Not only was he smug and argumentative and self-righteous, he had no idea what it meant to be a husband and father. Granted, Zach was a handsome man; not only that, his appearance proclaimed his success as a businessman, a professional. Although, in her opinion, anyone with half a brain would instantly peg him for an accountant. He had that narrowed look about his dark eyes, as if he spent too many hours a day squinting at columns of tiny numbers. Despite that, he was appealing to the eye with his broad shoulders&#x2014;which nicely set off his expensive suit&#x2014;and thick, dark hair. At one time he'd been an athlete, and even now he routinely jogged and kept in shape.<br><br>Rosie had loved the firmness of his muscles as she stroked his back during lovemaking. Of course, it'd been months since they'd slept in the same bed, and much longer since they'd actually made love.<br><br>Rosie didn't even remember the last time. Had she known, she might have appreciated it more, lingered a moment longer at her husband's side, savored the feel of his arms around her. One thing was certain: Zach hadn't been interested in her from the day he'd hired Janice Lamond as his personal assistant.<br><br>The thought of him entwined with Janice nearly suffocated Rosie and she forcefully shoved the image from her mind. Anger and revulsion at her husband's&#x2014;no, ex-husband's&#x2014;unfaithfulness rose like bile in the back of her throat.<br><br>Zach's raised voice caught her attention; apparently he'd agreed to have their attorneys negotiate this added complication to their divorce decree. Otto was checking with the clerk for an empty conference room.<br><br>Once a private room in the law library was secured, Zach and his attorney sat at one side of the table, across from Rosie and hers.<br><br>Even the attorneys seemed perplexed by the situation. "I can't say I've ever heard of such a decree before," Sharon said, starting the conversation.<br><br>"Me, neither." Otto frowned. "This is one for the books."<br><br>"Fine," Zach said in a curt voice, "it's unusual, but we're both adults. We can figure this out. I know <em>I</em> was sincere about putting the children first." He glared at Rosie, as if to suggest she hadn't been.<br><br>"If you were sincere, you would've had second thoughts about sleeping with that slut." Rosie hadn't intended to be argumentative, but if her ex-husband was so concerned about their children's welfare, he would never have broken his wedding vows.<br><br>"I refuse to dignify that remark by responding to it," Zach said through gritted teeth. "Besides, if you were home more, instead of volunteering for every cause known to mankind, every cause <em>except</em> your children, you'd&#x2014;"<br><br>"Well, I refuse to allow you to blame me for what <em>you've</em> done." Her volunteer efforts were Zach's big complaint. He had his wish; she'd had to resign from every position she held and seek paid employment. She hoped he was happy. For the first time since their children were born, Rosie wasn't a stay-at-home mom.<br><br>"I thought we were here to discuss this divorce decree?" Zach asked with a bored look, an expression that was obviously for her benefit. "If we're going to trade insults I'd rather not pay our attorneys to listen."<br><br><em>That's right,</em> Rosie mused, deriving a small sense of satisfaction out of knowing that Zach was responsible for both sets of attorneys' fees. He was the one with the high-paying job. She was currently taking summer classes to update her teaching certificate. Classes Zach was paying for. That was another notch in her belt&#x2014;another concession granted in their divorce settlement.<br><br>Her application was in with the South Kitsap School District and, considering all her connections, she shouldn't have any difficulty getting hired as a substitute teacher in September.<br><br>"Let's make a list of what we can agree on," Sharon said briskly, ignoring the antagonism between Rosie and Zach. "Despite the breakdown of your marriage, you both claim you want to keep the needs of your children first and foremost."<br><br>Rosie nodded and so did Zach.<br><br>Sharon smiled. She was a no-nonsense woman who wasn't swayed by emotion. "Okay, that gives us a place to start."<br><br>"I want to compliment you both on your attitudes," Otto said, removing a legal pad from his briefcase as if to prove he was earning his pay. Zach had chosen the best and, for that matter, so had Rosie. Both attorneys came with high price tags.<br><br>"Yeah," Zach said sarcastically. "If we got along any better, we might've stayed married."<br><br>"You know who to blame for that," Rosie snapped.<br><br>"Yes, I do," he snapped right back. "How many nights were you actually home? How many dinners did you cook? If you don't remember, I do. Damn few."<br><br>Sharon sighed audibly. "Okay, the kids come first, and at this point, they have the house, which means Rosie will need to find somewhere else to live for the three days a week when Zach's staying with them."<br><br><em>Somewhere else to live?</em> Rosie's head jerked up as the shock ran up and down her spine. The reality&#x2014;the repercussions of the judge's edict&#x2014;had just started to sink in.<br><br><em>"And</em> pay half the mortgage on the house," Zach added, smiling at her benignly.<br><br>"But I can't&#x2014;" Rosie hadn't realized, hadn't thought that far in advance. "I don't have a job yet&#x2014;how am I supposed to afford an apartment on top of everything else?" This was grossly unfair. Surely Zach could see that such a demand was unreasonable. She had a life, too, and no way of building it if every penny she earned went into paying for two separate residences.<br><br>Rosie stared at Zach. He returned her look, unblinking. "I have a suggestion," Sharon said.<br><br>"Let's hear it." Zach's lawyer sounded eager, if not desperate, for ideas.<br><br>"If Zach spends three days a week at the house with the children, then his apartment will sit empty, is that right?" She turned to Zach for verification.<br><br>Rosie studied him, too. In essence, Sharon was asking if Zach intended to move Janice into the apartment, Janice and her son, who was the same age as Eddie.<br><br>"The apartment will be empty," Zach said emphatically.<br><br>"What if&#x2014;&#x2014;" Sharon glanced from one to the other "&#x2014;Rosie moves into the apartment during the time you're at the house? You did say it was a two-bedroom apartment, didn't you?"<br><br>Objections shot up like weeds in Rosie's fertile mind. She didn't want anything to do with Zach. She certainly didn't want to be put in a situation where she had to deal with being around him or his things&#x2014;or what had been <em>their</em> things. Nor did she want to be privy to any information regarding his relationship with his girlfriend.<br><br>"No way am I letting Rosie in my apartment." Apparently Zach shared her qualms. "We're divorced. It took months to get that way. Rosie wanted out and she got her wish."<br><br>"You were the one who moved out," she reminded him scornfully.<br><br>"Correction. You kicked me out."<br><br>"If you'll recall, <em>you</em> insisted I see an attorney." She couldn't believe how convenient his memory was.<br><br>Zach snorted and looked at Sharon. "More fool me."<br><br>Rosie's attorney raised both hands in a pleading gesture. "Listen, it's just a suggestion&#x2014;a way of saving money for you both." She turned to Rosie. "You'll be fortunate to find a place, even a studio apartment, for less than five, six hundred dollars a month."<br><br>"Zach will have to pay&#x2014;"<br><br>"The hell I will!"<br><br>"The divorce is final," Otto Benson stated. "Zach isn't responsible for anything more than what's already been agreed to."<br><br>Rosie's gaze flew to her attorney, and Sharon reluctantly nodded. All at once, this was more than Rosie could bear. Not only had she lost her husband, but now she was being forced out of her home, too. Moisture welled in her eyes, and she managed to blink it away. Hell would freeze over before she let Zach know what he was doing to her.<br><br>A long moment passed before Zach finally spoke. "Okay, I'll agree to let Rosie stay in the apartment on the days I'm at the house, as long as she's willing to split the rent."<br><br>Rosie was well aware that she had no choice, but she did have her pride and she was determined to hold on to that. "On one condition," she insisted, lifting her head.<br><br>"Now what?" Zach asked with a long-suffering sigh.<br><br>"I don't want you bringing that woman into the family home. I want our house to be a safe place for the children. In other words, I don't want Allison and Eddie exposed to your women."<br><br><em>"What?"</em> Zach glared at her as though she'd spoken a foreign language.<br><br>"You heard me," she said vehemently, meeting his angry eyes. "This divorce has been hard enough on the kids without you parading Janice or any other woman you decide to date through my home. I want the house off-limits to your...your floozies."<br><br>"Floozies?" Zach smirked. "Fine, no <em>floozies.</em> And the same goes for you. I don't want you bringing any men to the house, either. No studs, no hotties, no boy toys, no&#x2014;"<br><br>"Oh, that's rich," Rosie broke in, putting an end to his ridicule. In seventeen years she'd never so much as looked at another man. Not since the day she'd met Zach.<br><br>"Do you or don't you agree?" her ex-husband challenged.<br><br>"Of course I agree!"<br><br>"Good."<br><br>"Perfect."<br><br>With their attorneys present, they made decisions about a number of other issues, and Sharon quickly wrote up an agreement. Zach's attorney reviewed it, and then both Zach and Rosie signed it.<br><br>By the time she left the courthouse, Rosie felt as if she'd been pummeled by wave after wave in a stormy sea. Strange as it seemed, her heart actually ached. For weeks she'd dreaded this day and at the same time longed for it, just so the divorce would finally be over. Now she wasn't sure <em>what</em> she felt, other than this deep pain that threatened to overpower her.<br><br>Nine-year-old Eddie was shooting baskets when Rosie pulled into the driveway at 311 Pelican Court. In a little more than a month, school would start again. Perhaps then their lives would return to some semblance of routine.<br><br>Eddie caught the basketball and held it against his side as he waited for her to park the car in the garage. His sad dark eyes watched Rosie as he stepped aside so she could drive past.<br><br>Fifteen-year-old Allison was in the kitchen, microwaving a hot dog for lunch. She turned and stared at Rosie, eyes glittering defiantly. She resembled Zach so much just then.<br><br>"How'd it go?" Eddie asked, following Rosie into the kitchen. He continued to hold the basketball.<br><br>"All right, I guess."<br><br>The microwave beeped and Allison removed the steaming wiener, devoid of a bun. As if it had suddenly lost its appeal, she set the plate on the countertop and studied Rosie.<br><br>"There's been a...minor complication," Rosie announced. She didn't believe in hiding the truth from her children, especially when it involved something that would affect them.<br><br>"What kind of complication?" Eddie asked, pulling out a kitchen chair. He balanced the basketball on the table, one hand supporting it. Allison crossed her arms and leaned against the counter, pretending to be bored; still, she didn't leave the room as she so often did.<br><br>With effort Rosie managed to show a bit of enthusiasm for Judge Lockhart's decree. "Well...you guys won't be moving in and out of the house every few days, after all."<br><br>Allison and Eddie shared a look of surprise. Trying to sound positive, Rosie explained Judge Lockhart's...</p><h2>Hatter M, Vol. 3: The Nature of Wonder</h2><p>In Volume 3, The Nature of Wonder, Royal Bodyguard Hatter Madigan follows the Glow of the setting sun into America's wild west in search of Wonderland's lost princess.

Madigan springs forth from the wandering-gunslinger mold with great appeal, and the story follows an enjoyably eccentric course, but it is once again Makkonens beautifully expressive art, bordering on the surreal, that suggests the danger and thrill of true insanity lurking at the edges of the minds eye.

Some early books, translated from the Chinese, make hilarious reading and are virtually impossible to comprehend. Most books for beginners assume that the reader has some elementary knowledge of the game.<br>In this well-thoughtout book, the player is introduced to every phase by a clear explanation followed by illustrations which enable an easy step-by-step development of the game. Scoring is set out in simple tabulated form, with illustrations of scoring for specific hands.<br>Altogether fifty-one hands are fully illustrated making this an invaluable handbook for newcomer and experienced player alike.</p><p>Patricia Thompson and Betty Maloney are well established experts in Mah Jong and have written several books on the game.</p><h2>The Chamber</h2><p>In the corridors of Chicago's top law firm: <br><br>Twenty-six-year-old Adam Hall stands on the brink&nbsp;&nbsp;of a brilliant legal career.

While&nbsp;&nbsp;the executioners prepare the gas chamber, while&nbsp;&nbsp;the protesters gather and the TV&nbsp;&nbsp;cameras wait, Adam has only days, hours, minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;to save his client.

Yet in a time of crisis, he sought personal advancement, becoming the most prominent German intellectual to join the Nazis.<br><br> Hannah Arendt, his brilliant, beautiful student and young lover, sought to enable a decent society of human beings in relation to one other. She was courageous in the time of crisis. Years later, she was even able to meet Heidegger once again on common ground and to find in his past behavior an insight into Nazism that would influence her reflections on &#x201c;the banality of evil&#x201d;&#x2015;a concept that remains bitterly controversial and profoundly influential to this day.<br><br> But how could Arendt have renewed her friendship with Heidegger? And how has this relationship affected her reputation as a cultural critic? In <em>Stranger from Abroad</em>, Daniel Maier-Katkin offers a compassionate portrait that provides much-needed insight into this relationship.<br><br> Maier-Katkin creates a detailed and riveting portrait of Arendt&#x2019;s rich intellectual and emotional life, shedding light on the unique bond she shared with her second husband, Heinrich Bl�cher, and on her friendships with Mary McCarthy, W. H. Auden, Karl Jaspers, and Randall Jarrell&#x2015;all fascinating figures in their own right. An elegant, accessible introduction to Arendt&#x2019;s life and work, <em>Stranger from Abroad</em> makes a powerful and hopeful case for the lasting relevance of Arendt&#x2019;s thought.</p><p>Daniel Maier-Katkin is a professor of criminology and criminal justice and a Fellow of the Center for the Advancement of Human Rights at Florida State University.

After acquiring Brenin as a cub, it quickly became apparent that Breinin was never to be left alone, as the consequences to Mark&#x2019;s house and its contents were dire. As a result, Brenin and Mark went everywhere together&#x2015;from classroom lecture to Ireland, England, and France. More than just an exotic pet, Brenin exerted an immense influence on Rowlands as both a person, and, strangely enough, as a philosopher, leading him to re-evaluate his attitude to love, happiness, nature and death. By turns funny (what do you do when your wolf eats your air-conditioning unit?) and poignant, this life-affirming book will make you reappraise what it means to be human.<br></p><p>Mark Rowlands is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Miami and the author of The Philosopher and the Wolf. His books have been translated into fifteen languages.&#x201c;The wolf . . . is the clearing in the human soul. The wolf uncovers what is hidden.&#x201d; A philosophy professor and author (Body Language, 2006), Rowlands grew up with dogs, big dogs, so when he saw an advertisement for wolf cubs, he went to have a look. When he saw the soft, fluffy cubs and their imposing parents, he took one home that day. Since his new pup, called Brenin, could not be at home alone without leaving utter destruction in his wake, Rowlands begain to take him everywhere. By training the wolf to take his lead, Rowlands taught Brenin how to be comfortable with all sorts of circumstances. Their remarkable closeness, both physical and mental, led to this book&#x2014;a sort of autobiography mixed with wolf philosophy, human philosophy, and an exploration of the bonds between human and animal. Discussing what humans can learn from wolves, Rowlands elevates the run-of-the-mill memoir about life with an exotic pet into something more, a treatise on the meaning of true companionship. This one moves well beyond the Rascal mode. --Nancy Bent</p><h2>The Story of Babar: The Little Elephant</h2><p>The classic first story about literature�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most beloved pachyderm. After his mother is killed by a hunter, Babar avoids capture by escaping to the city, where he is befriended by the kindly Old Lady. He becomes educated and cultured and, upon his return to the great forest, is crowned King of the Elephants. Translated from Jean de Brunhoff's original French, the adventures of the world's most popular elephant and his friends have enchanted an three generations. Delightfully amusing illustrations make this short collection of classic Babar tales a book to treasure for children young and old.</p><p><i>The Story of Babar</i>--the early adventures of the enduring, endearing elephant--was written in 1931 by French writer Jean de Brunhoff (1899-1937). Since then, it has been translated into at least 12 languages. It's amazing how much can happen to one little elephant in the course of one little book: Babar loses his mother to a hunter, wanders into the city, gets a new wardrobe, becomes the hit of high society, marries his cousin C�leste (totally acceptable in contemporary Elephantine society), and is crowned King of the Elephants. <p> <i>The Story of Babar</i> is essentially the tale of a country boy who comes to the city and, while there, comes of age. In the end, he returns home to share his knowledge and experiences with family and friends. The beautiful, delightfully detailed illustrations--de Brunhoff was a painter by trade--never fail to amuse. (Although none of the characters seem to notice, the sight of Babar in a suit leaning against the mantel while he regales his audience with tales of the jungle is plainly hilarious.) All of the Babar books are notable for their ability to tell larger stories with simplicity and style, and <i>The Story of Babar</i> is no exception. Potentially troubling moments--the death of Babar's mother, for example--are handled with taste, emphasizing Babar's unique gift for uncovering a silver lining in the most persistent of clouds.

A gorgeous celebrity with a killer sense of style, Lisa lives in Los Angeles with her husband (actor Harry Hamlin) and her two daughters.<b></b><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>I stood in my bedroom, naked, and looking in the mirror. It was not a pretty sight. I was thirty-eight years old, and had given birth to my second daughter the previous year. Despite a bout of soul-crushing postpartum depression (my second), I had managed to lose the thirty pounds I had gained, and my body was almost back to its pre-baby shape. But after breast-feeding two babies, my breasts hung from my chest like two pathetic, deflated balloons, and I felt about as sexual as a coat rack.</p><p>I hated looking in the mirror (not a healthy trait in anyone, let alone an actress). I felt unattractive, dried up, dead. My sex life with my husband was practically nonexistent, but after ten years together and two kids, whose wasn't? That was what I told myself. I blamed it on our busy schedules, or the lingering effects of postpartum depression, but deep down I knew I was fooling myself. It was me -- plain and simple. I didn't feel good about myself, and I transferred these feelings to my family, my marriage, my sex life, and my career (or in those days, the lack of one). I had been let go from my second stint on the soap opera <i>Days of Our Lives</i> the year before, after a two-year run on <i>Melrose Place</i>. To say I was in a rut was an understatement. I had set up camp there.</p><p>What had happened to me? I had what most people would kill for -- a fabulous husband and soul mate, two exquisite daughters, a home in Beverly Hills, the career I had always dreamed of (current dry spell notwithstanding), and I was in good physical shape. I wondered if there was something in my genes that prevented me from appreciating what I had. Truth be told, despite my sunny exterior, I had never been a "happy" person. Throughout my twenties and thirties, I always carried a vague feeling of unease, the sense that <i>something</i> was missing. In the business I'm in, feeling insecure at times is part of the deal, but I'm pretty sure I would have felt the same way had I still been living anonymously, outside of Hollywood.</p><p>It's not as if I was a stranger to obstacles. Growing up in the small town of Medford, Oregon, I visibly stood out. I was different. With my dark olive skin and dark brown hair, I didn't look like anyone else. I fought for everything I got. But if I was passionate about something, nothing stood in my way. And even as a little girl, I dreamed of being a star. My parents always told me that I could do anything, and I believed them. My goal was to get out of Oregon and <i>be somebody</i>. For twenty years, I persevered, pushing through rejection and tough times. My faith never faltered.</p><p>Over the years, in my quest for the key to true happiness, I've read a library's worth of self-help books, starting with <i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i> and <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>. I have explored various spiritual practices. I saw a therapist for eleven years, long after the relationship had served its usefulness. Yet I never found the key.</p><p>I knew my problems were small compared to the problems of millions of others. But you can only walk in the shoes you're in, and these shoes weren't just hurting me; they were affecting my marriage and my family. How could I take care of them if I couldn't take care of myself? What kind of example was I setting for my daughters?</p><p>I had to admit to myself that the funk was largely all my own doing; that I was the problem. I've always been one who believes that if you can identify the problem, you can fix it. Or alternatively you can stick your head in the sand and vainly hope it will go away. Obviously, it wasn't going to go away on its own.</p><p>Finally, my "never quit" gene kicked in. I realized I had to fix myself first, and then I'd be able to tackle the rest of the dissatisfaction in my life. And where, you ask, did I start? By learning how to give a lap dance! Yes, a lap dancing class changed my life -- it reconnected me to my sexuality and forced me to let go of my inhibitions. I got my mojo back and then some, and my husband got the old (along with the new and improved) Lisa back. Suddenly I was no longer self-conscious about my body. I picked up some new bedroom tricks, and dusted off some oldies but goodies (much, much more on this in the sex chapter). Needless to say, we were both pretty happy campers.</p><p>I discovered that I had the power to change anything in my life. Instead of sitting around feeling sorry for myself, and potentially losing my husband, I did something about it. This was the first step in renewing the life I wanted, one in which I looked and felt my best.</p><p>Also around that time, a lifetime of reading self-help books finally clicked. Reading <i>The Secret</i> was an important key. Even though I was familiar with many versions of its core philosophies, this time I was ready for the message and really embraced it. As the Buddhists say, "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear." I learned that all our thoughts are really just self-fulfilling prophecies. It didn't matter what I <i>did</i>, it was how I <i>felt</i> and <i>thought</i> about it. The negative self-talk and thoughts I had engaged in most of my life were what had been holding me back. Simplistic as this may sound, allowing myself to be open and consciously trying to stay positive all the time and be proactive worked for me big-time. I felt confident, in control, and lo and behold, <i>happy</i> for the first time in my life. Now I know this might sound too easy, but trust me, it's work and you have to be diligent.</p><p>I had experienced what I call a <i>Rinnavation</i>, a way to make a change and reboot my life by opening myself up to new possibilities, opportunities, and experiences. A Rinnavation is when you realize you want to change your life and you're committed to making it happen. It can start with a baby step, like taking a five-minute walk every day to kick-start an exercise routine, or a leap, like starting a business. Regardless of how you choose to embark on your own Rinnavation, the root cause is always the same -- you acknowledge that something is a little (or a lot) off in your life, and you resolve to do something to start pulling yourself up out of the rut.</p><p><i>Rinnavation</i> is, simply put, about looking your best, feeling your best, and doing your best, at every age and stage of life. We all have times in our lives when we feel just the opposite. You've packed on a few pounds, your social life is nonexistent, you hate your job, or something you can't even put your finger on is holding you back. I am a firm believer in action when this happens -- whenever I have hit a roadblock in my life, doing something, anything, gets me on track to finding the solution. After all, you can't hit a moving target. And whether it is diet or exercise, starting a beauty routine, or changing your hairstyle, sometimes the <i>littlest</i> thing can make a huge difference. Even just by changing your thoughts, you can change your life. The key is, the change always starts with a positive outlook -- sure, something isn't quite clicking, but you're going to start fixing it right now -- and it often leads to much more than you originally set out to accomplish.</p><p>Getting my mojo back was just the beginning of a domino effect. I opened my first Belle Gray store in 2002 and then expanded to a second location in 2004. I was offered <i>Dancing with the Stars</i> in 2006. The following year, I starred in <i>Chicago</i> on Broadway. Who would have ever thought? I had never sung or danced professionally in my life! That same year, I was hired as the red-carpet commentator for the TV Guide Network. Since then I never look back. I look <i>forward</i> to every day because I have put my goals out there into the universe, and keep reaching for them. I'm always looking for the next Rinnavation.</p><p>I've never publicly discussed many of the personal details you'll read in the pages to follow. I'm sharing them with you now because the process of writing this book made me realize that all of these things -- the good and the bad -- are pieces of the puzzle, my puzzle, and I had to lay out all the pieces in order to see the bigger picture and what would work for me. Don't worry -- I won't be getting all New Age on you. Positive thinking alone can't make you lose weight and get fit, nor will it give you a great haircut or fabulous style. These are the other pieces of the puzzle, but everything's connected. To look great you have to feel great, and vice versa. I've spent decades experimenting with every beauty, diet, exercise, and fashion regimen there is. What I've learned could fill a library (and what I've spent experimenting could sustain an entire bank). Since you probably barely have time to read this book, I have distilled just the best stuff, enough to get you on track for your own Rinnavation.</p><p>You may be seeking to revamp your appearance through diet, exercise, or a new beauty routine. I've been there. It is part of my job to look good at all times whether I like it or not, and this is especially true when I am in front of the camera. But I don't wake up every morning looking red-carpet ready. Far from it! Sometimes my face looks like a pizza because I have so many zits, I feel bloated, or my skin looks less than sun-kissed. Through the years, I've perfected the secrets to looking my best in the least amount of time -- I've had to in order to survive in this business! I've culled information from the top hair stylists, makeup artists, exercise gurus, doctors, and fashion stylists, and I'm ready to pass it along. I've been so lucky to work with amazing people, but the truth is that anyone can do these, without a team of experts, and with minimal cost and time.</p><p>You might be trying to refocus your life on something you love. I know what that's like, too. Over the years, through will and necessity, I've learned to make my personal passions the driving forces of my life: fashion, fitness, marriage, sex, motherhood, dancing, and spirituality. Realizing these passions in the first place is what keeps me focused and motivated. Fortunately, I have been able to channel these passions, both personally and pro...</p></p><h2>Fight: A Christian Case for Non-Violence</h2><p><i>Fight</i> explores violence in the Bible and challenges us to live out Jesus&#x2019; call to non-violence. With prophetic relevance, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Preston Sprinkle tackles the controversy surrounding violence and grapples with surprising conclusions. Anyone who has struggled with the morality of violence will appreciate this convincing biblical guide. <br></p><p><b>What Are We Fighting For?</b>&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still an evangelical Christian. And I&#x2019;m not Amish, Quaker, or Mennonite. I own several guns and still believe that the smell of a recently fired shotgun on a crisp fall morning comes darn near close to paradise. But I&#x2019;ve tried my hardest to understand God&#x2019;s Word and the diverse perspectives of those who read it. And the more I study, the more I discuss, the more I&#x2019;ve become convinced: Christians shouldn&#x2019;t kill or use violence&#x2014;not even in war.&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;With these words, Preston Sprinkle jumps into a compelling, passionate study of God&#x2019;s perspective on violence. Examining both the seemingly angry, violent God of the Old Testament and the peacemaking Jesus of the New, Preston takes us back to Scripture to discern how God has really called His people to think and live in the midst of a violent world. He asks us to join him in inviting God to challenge our presuppositions, to set aside our biases and backgrounds and fears ... and to seek above all else to faithfully follow the Savior who humbly submitted to God in the face of injustice and violence.<br><p><b>Preston Sprinkle </b>is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling co-author of <i>Erasing Hell: What God Said About Eternity, and the Things We've Made Up</i>.

Has baseball crafted its own image or instead been at the mercy of broader forces shaping our society and the globe?<i>The Empire Strikes Out</i> gives us the sweeping story of how baseball and America are intertwined in the export of the American way.&#x201d;<br><br>From the Civil War to George W. Bush and the Iraq War, we see baseball&#x2019;s role in developing the American empire, first at home and then beyond our shores. And from Albert Spalding and baseball&#x2019;s first World Tour to Bud Selig and the World Baseball Classic, we witness the globalization of America&#x2019;s national pastime and baseball&#x2019;s role in spreading the American dream. Besides describing baseball&#x2019;s frequent and often surprising connections to America&#x2019;s presence around the world, Elias assesses the effects of this relationship both on our foreign policies and on the sport itself and asks whether baseball can play a positive role or rather only reinforce America&#x2019;s dominance around the globe. Like Franklin Foer in<i>How Soccer Explains the World</i>, Elias is driven by compelling stories, unusual events, and unique individuals. His seamless integration of original research and compelling analysis makes this a baseball book that&#x2019;s about more than just sports.</p><p>Mixing sharp political analysis and compelling lore, an eye-opening look at baseball's relationship to American empire, from the revolutionary era to the present <p><b>Advance praise</b>: <br><i>The Empire Strikes Out</i> is a rare and wonderful combination of splendid scholarship and lively writing. Robert Elias' affection for baseball illuminates its pages, even when he is unearthing episodes of organized baseball's racism, jingoism, unbridled militarism and insensitivity to other cultures. Simultaneously, and gracefully, the book describes the development of baseball and its impact overseas as a sort of quasi instrument of American foreign policy. <br>The recent internationalization of major-league rosters makes the book particularly timely. A truly fine work. Highly recommended. <br><b>- Roger Kahn, author of <i>The Boys of Summer</i>, <i>The Era</i>, <i>Memories of Summer</i>, <i>October Men</i>, <i>Joe and Marilyn</i>, etc.</b> </p><p>Lively and provocative, this is the "big picture" look at the entangled, and sometimes nefarious, relationship between our national pastime and American diplomacy, militarism, and globalization. Well crafted, it is, at once, nuanced, imaginative, and provocative. Robert Elias' provides a riveting account of how our national pastime has been part and parcel of American diplomacy, militarism, and globalization.This is the definitive account of how baseball has been used to sell and export the American dream. <br><b>- George Gmelch, author of <i>Baseball Without Borders</i>, <i>Inside Pitch</i>, <i>In the Ballpark</i>, etc.</b></p><b>Robert Elias</b> teaches law and politics at the University of San Francisco.

Detective Devereaux&#x2014;a man you can&#x2019;t quite trust and should never ignore&#x2014;must put a stop to the elusive pyromaniac&#x2019;s reign of terror before more damage is done.

But as Devereaux sifts through the ashes of the case, a grisly discovery at a burned-out school sends the investigation spiraling in a new, terrifying direction. The detective and his partner are dragged into a nightmare world by revelations of gruesome rituals, the disappearance of local citizens, and allegations against city officials of shocking crimes that stretch back decades.<br> &nbsp;<br> With innocent lives on the line, progress is hampered by friction between the police department and the FBI, and interference from factions of the local underworld complicate matters further. Devereaux doesn&#x2019;t make excuses for his willingness to work outside the lines, but just as he needs to be at the top of his game, he&#x2019;s rocked by echoes from his troubled past that threaten to engulf his daughter and girlfriend&#x2014;and fracture the life he&#x2019;s only recently begun to rebuild.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>False Friend</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The second installment starring [Detective Cooper] Devereaux is a suspenseful action-packed drama that is sure to please fans of the series and mystery/thriller lovers alike.

Afternoon.<br><br>The flames were already twenty feet tall.<br><br>They were a fierce orange color, twisting and writhing above the gash they&#x2019;d torn in the building&#x2019;s flat roof. Tyler Shaw thought they looked like the souls of sinners trying to escape the Hell that had somehow been unleashed inside. Clouds of dense, filthy smoke were spewing from a row of broken second-�floor windows, staining the blue Alabama sky the kind of dirty black that hadn&#x2019;t been seen in Birmingham since the ironworks closed down. In his house across the street, lurking behind the faded bedroom drapes, Shaw could smell it. His eyes began to water. The fumes were bitter and sharp, not sweet and welcoming like the smoke from the barbeque pits and campfires he&#x2019;d missed so much while he was away. And he could hear the sirens. The place would soon be swarming with fire trucks.<br><br>And with police.<br><br>Why? The word bounced frantically around inside Shaw&#x2019;s head. Why was this happening? And why now? Had he made a giant mistake, coming back? Was it all over for him? Was he finally finished?<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Saturday. Afternoon.<br><br>Cooper Devereaux scanned the packed rows of seats all around him for the hundredth time, and what he saw only confirmed his conclusion: Despite the name of the play&#x2014;�and the alarming number of people who&#x2019;d come armed with family-�size boxes of Kleenex&#x2014;�he was the only one in the place who was truly mis�rable.<br><br>Devereaux had wanted to spend his Saturday afternoon at his cabin, working on its damaged roof. But Alexandra, his&#x2014;�what? girlfriend?&#x2014;�had other plans. She&#x2019;d been desperate to see the show together, and was so delighted when another lawyer she&#x2019;d done a favor for had bagged her tickets for the matin�e that Devereaux hadn&#x2019;t had it in him to disappoint her. And on balance, he figured that sacrificing one afternoon&#x2019;s satisfying labor was a small price to pay to make her happy. He&#x2019;d been separated from Alexandra for eight years, and Devereaux was ready to do&#x2014;�almost&#x2014;�anything to strengthen his newly-�repaired relationship with her. And with Nicole, their seven-�year-�old daughter. He&#x2019;d only recently discovered that she existed, and was still just getting to know the little girl. Devereaux glanced down at her, stretched out in the seat between him and Alexandra. She looked up and smiled, then went back to watching the play. Or pretending to. Devereaux could see that she was paying more attention to the banged-�up doll she&#x2019;d insisted on bringing than to the action on the stage. Smart kid, he thought.<br><br>Devereaux had mentioned his lack of enthusiasm for Alexandra&#x2019;s play-�going scheme to a couple of the other detectives in his squad the day before, but they&#x2019;d told him not to worry. A trip to the Alabama Theatre was worth it just to see the inside of the building, they&#x2019;d said. Devereaux didn&#x2019;t agree. The contractors who&#x2019;d handled the refurbishment certainly hadn&#x2019;t skimped on the gold leaf or the extravagant palette of colors, but the result made Devereaux feel giddy. The red and green octagons decorating the underneath of the long sweeping arches reminded him of the suckers on an octopus&#x2019;s tentacles, reaching around to grab him. And the broad illuminated dome set into the gilded ceiling made him feel like a flying saucer was hovering overhead, waiting to spirit him away. Or perhaps that was just wishful thinking . . .<br><br>Devereaux was aware that his attention was wandering. His head kept filling with images of the flawless monochrome interior of his apartment in the City Federal Building. It was only a couple of blocks away. Could he sneak out, head over there, grab a beer, listen to some real music, and be back before the final curtain? There was time. But no. He couldn&#x2019;t take the chance. Alexandra would notice. She&#x2019;d be upset, and that was the last thing he wanted. So he fixed a smile on his face, dragged his attention back to the stage, and realized he&#x2019;d lost track of what was happening. This Valjean guy and his cronies wanted to go beyond some barricades? OK. But weren&#x2019;t they the ones who&#x2019;d built the barricades? Why pick that spot if they wanted to go past? Why not build the barricades farther away? And why stand around singing about their own lack of planning skills? What was the point in that?<br><br>Before he could torment himself any longer Devereaux felt his phone begin to vibrate. He discreetly checked the number and saw it was his boss, Lieutenant Hale. An opportunity to escape? Devereaux felt a flood of relief wash over him. He turned to mime 911 to Alexandra and felt a tiny part of that relief turn to guilt as she shot him daggers in return. Then he pushed the feelings away, slipped into the aisle, and hurried to the foyer to answer the call.<br><br>&#x201c;Cooper? Apologies. I didn&#x2019;t want to pull you out of the show.&#x201d; Hale&#x2019;s voice sounded distant and hollow, so Devereaux guessed she had him on speakerphone.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d; Devereaux crossed to the ornate, circular, four-�person French-�style lounge chair below the chandelier in the center of the rectangular space. No one else was sitting on it, but Dev�ereaux decided he&#x2019;d prefer to stand, anyway.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not enjoying it?&#x201d; Hale sounded surprised. &#x201c;Actually, that can wait. We&#x2019;ve got a situation. At a school, out on 31st Street, Southwest. Near Jefferson Avenue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jones Valley?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. You know it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I went to it. For a while, anyway. It was my first high school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must be mixing it up with somewhere else. This one&#x2019;s a middle school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same place. They changed it after I left. What happened there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A fire. A big one. Lots of damage, by the sound of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No reports of any casualties. Shouldn&#x2019;t have been any kids around as it&#x2019;s not a weekday, and there&#x2019;s no on-�site janitor or maintenance guys anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Want me to head over there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. No point. The uniforms are already canvassing the area, and no one will be able to get into the school itself for another couple of days, because it&#x2019;s not safe. But listen. A battalion chief from Fire and Rescue just called. This isn&#x2019;t confirmed yet&#x2014;�his science guys need more time to collect samples and run tests&#x2014;�but his gut feel is that the blaze was started deliberately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lightning striking twice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Papers rustled on Hale&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no mention of previous fires in the report.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was a long time ago.&#x201d; Devereaux glared at an usher who&#x2019;d appeared from an anteroom at the far end of the lobby, apparently ready to shush him. &#x201c;November eleventh, 1961. The date was in the school crest. Some crazy student torched the place. Burned it to the ground. Maybe history&#x2019;s repeating itself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe it is. But we&#x2019;ll get to that later. For now, step one is to interview the witnesses. The battalion chief needs some very specific information, until the lab work comes back. He laid it out in an email, which I&#x2019;ll forward to you. The uniforms have got the local residents covered, but we also have a passerby who called 911. I want you and Tommy to go talk to him. Right away, while his memory&#x2019;s still fresh. And before he reads anything about it in the press. I&#x2019;ll include his deets in the email.&#x201d;<br><br>Devereaux crossed the shiny black-�and-�white-�tiled floor, stepped outside, and paused beneath the illuminated canopy on Third Avenue as he felt the warm air engulf him. He imagined his old school in flames, and couldn&#x2019;t help but smile. Not because he&#x2019;d particularly disliked the place. But because he was struck by the irony. Today he was being sent to investigate the fire. Back when he was a student, he&#x2019;d have been the first one the police would have blamed for it.<br><br>Labor Omnia Vincit, the school motto said. Labor overcomes all difficulties. Despite the creepy Nazi overtones, Devereaux had always found it to be true. Especially as it didn&#x2019;t stipulate what kind of labor . . .<br><br>Chapter Three<br><br>Saturday. Afternoon.<br><br>Squeezed onto a triangle of land to the west of the city, between Third Avenue North and Valley Creek, the Birmingham Tribune building had been dividing local opinion for nearly forty years. Some saw it as an iconic brutalist masterpiece, and lauded its intelligent, innovative design. They pointed to the way the front of the building was shaped like the prow of a ship, so that its protruding second floor could shelter the entrance and allow both the set-�back higher floors to have their own outdoor balcony spaces. But the majority thought of it as a hideous monstrosity. They loathed its rough, textured concrete. Its sharp angles. Its parallel strips of featureless black windows. The bad feeling ran so high that its harshest critics likened it to a child&#x2019;s drawing of an ocean liner, and said they wished they could push it into the nearby water and let it sink.<br><br>Diane McKinzie didn&#x2019;t have an opinion on the building&#x2019;s appearance, one way or the other. She was too used to the place. It had been around her whole life&#x2014;�opening the year she was born&#x2014;�and her father had started taking her there before she could walk. She&#x2019;d visited constantly throughout her childhood, and when she got a job there right out of college it felt like she was coming home.<br><br>Please let it be a quiet day! Diane thought as she reversed her Mini into the last shaded spot in the parking lot. She had good news, from a personal point of view, and couldn&#x2019;t wait to get home and share it with her son, Daniel. She&#x2019;d just heard from an old friend. An editor in New York. His company was publishing a new biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the legendary physicist who&#x2019;d led the Manhattan Project in World War II. The destroyer of worlds, as he&#x2019;d described himself. The book sounded fabulous, casting new light on the difficulties the young Robert experienced in getting along with other students, and the trouble he landed himself in politically, later in life. There was no doubt about it, Oppenheimer was a fascinating guy. He was one of Daniel&#x2019;s heroes. And Diane&#x2019;s friend was going to send him an advance copy of the book&#x2014;�the kind normally reserved for reviewers to use. That meant Daniel would get it months before it hit the shelves. He could potentially be the first person in the world, outside the publishing industry, to read it. He&#x2019;d be delighted! And Diane loved to see him happy. He was so smart, and he worked so hard, despite not being in the best situation at school. He deserved a little special treatment from time to time.<br><br>At first Diane had thought about telling Daniel about the book the next day, when they were planning to visit the McWane Science Center in downtown Birmingham together. But she soon rejected that idea. She knew herself too well. She&#x2019;d never be able to keep it a secret that long. No. She&#x2019;d tell him that night, over his favorite dinner . . .<br><br>Diane was still looking forward to the evening when she got back to her desk. She had to write up some notes from the interview she&#x2019;d just done, to account for her time. She couldn&#x2019;t be too careful these days. The era when journalists could be out of the office for hours&#x2014;�days!&#x2014;�at a time without anyone turning a hair was long gone. She also had to confirm some technical details with the one remaining staff photographer for a job she was planning for the following week. But mostly she had to make sure that all the important people saw she was there, working hard. And then, if she was lucky, she could get on the road early for a change.</p><h2>Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception</h2><p>A new edition of an influential study of Attention Disorder, which argues that the condition is rooted in human evolution, includes new supporting evidence and reflects new advances in non-drug treatments. Original. 25,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo. Tour. IP.</p><p>In the revised and updated edition of this book, released in August, Hartmann cites several well-researched recent books and studies which bolster his view that the major problem shared by people with ADD today is that they are living in a culture designed for those who are genetically disposed to grow their food rather than to hunt for it. Hartmann takes a positive view of ADD, stressing the successes that those with ADD can have using their talents and skills rather than dwelling on their difficulties. His work marks the first time an author characterized ADD as something other than a disease.The author, thom@cis.compuserve.com , 07/19/96: A positive look at ADD and a new theory of its origin... I wrote this book because when my son was diagnosed with ADD the psychologist told him he had a &#34;damaged brain&#34; and gave him a whole gloom-and-doom scenario. Having been the executive director of a residential treatment facility for kids, many of whom had ADD, I thought this was a pretty miserable way to portray ADD to anybody, particularly a child. In ADD:ADP, I present a &#34;new view&#34; of the origin of ADD -- that it&#39;s an adaptive mechanism passed down to us by our ancient &#34;Hunter/Gatherer&#34; ancestors. At first, I only meant this as a paradigm or metaphor, but as you&#39;ll find from reading this revised version, it is turning out to be good science as well. In the five years since the original version of this book came out, a number of important studies have shown that there is a basis in history and science for my theories. I hope you enjoy the book and look forward to hearing your responses to it,</p><h2>Chess Puzzles</h2><p>Gathers chess problems involving each piece, checkmates, and chess strategy, and includes clues and answers</p><p></p><h2>The Case of the Left-Handed Lady: An Enola Holmes Mystery</h2><p>Enola Holmes is hiding from the world&#x2019;s most famous detective&#x2014;her own brother, Sherlock Holmes. But when she discovers a hidden cache of bold, brilliant charcoal drawings, she can&#x2019;t help but venture out to find who drew them: young Lady Cecily, who has disappeared from her bedroom without a trace. Braving midnight streets where murderers roam, Enola must unravel the clues&#x2014;a leaning ladder, a shifty-eyed sales clerk, political pamphlets&#x2014;but in order to save Lady Cecily from a powerful villain, Enola risks revealing more than she should . . .<p> In her follow-up to <i>The Case of the Missing Marquess,</i> which received four starred reviews, two-time Edgar Award winner Nancy Springer brings us back to the danger and intrigue of Victorian London as she continues the adventures of one of the wittiest and most exciting new heroines in today&#x2019;s literature.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Nancy Springer</b> has published forty novels for adults, young adults and children. In a career beginning shortly after she graduated from Gettysburg College in 1970, Springer wrote for ten years in the imaginary realms of mythological fantasy, then ventured on contemporary fantasy, magical realism, and women's fiction before turning her attention to children's literature. Her novels and stories for middle-grade and young adults range from contemporary realism, mystery/crime, and fantasy to her critically acclaimed novels based on the Arthurian mythos, I AM MORDRED: A TALE OF CAMELOT and I AM MORGAN LE FAY. Springer's children's books have won her two Edgar Allan Poe awards, a Carolyn W. Field award, various Children's Choice honors and numerous ALA Best Book listings. Her most recent series include the Tales of Rowan Hood, featuring Robin Hood&#x2019;s daughter, and the Enola Holmes mysteries, starring the much younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.<p> Ms. Springer lives in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. </p>Grade 5&#x2013;9&#x2014;Fourteen-year-old Enola Holmes is intelligent, sassy, and a woman before her time, living incognito in Victorian London and working as a Perditorian. She is on the run from her famous older brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, who feel she belongs in a boarding school learning to be a lady. Using various aliases, disguises, and ciphers, Enola is on the case to find the missing teenage daughter of Sir Eustance Austair while trying to elude "capture" by her siblings. She finds herself in the back alleys of London, using her wits to locate the missing Lady Cecily while also trying to keep herself out of mortal peril. Though readers' interest will be piqued by the references to Enola's first adventure, <i>The Case of the Missing Marquess</i> (Philomel, 2006), this title stands alone. Fans of Blue Balliet's <i>Chasing Vermeer</i> (2004) and <i>The Wright 3</i> (2006, both Scholastic) and Ellen Raskin's <i>The Westing Game</i> (Dutton, 1978) will surely enjoy the suspense and the fresh voice of this young sleuth.&#x2014;<i>Angela M.

Trained as a biologist, Kingsolver writes authoritatively, and movingly, about the continent&#39;s virgin pockets of desert, coast, grassland, forest, and wetland. ONE-OF-A-KIND IMAGES: Specially commissioned infrared photographs, taken and hand-tinted by Belt, create a painterly portrait of wild landscapes that gives this an art book appeal. NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPERTISE: Readers look to the Geographic as a leading expert in the geography and ecology of America. America&#39;s virgin lands are not always where you&#39;d expect to find them - in national parks or other preserves. They&#39;re scattered in often small, sometimes barely known pockets across the continent. These are the remnants that remind us of what wildness once meant - and what will be lost if it disappears. In her moving introduction and in the essays that open each chapter, Kingsolver discusses the ways of wilderness, the threats against it, its natural imperatives and what it needs to survive in the different forms featured in the chapters - as grassland, wetland, dryland, coast, and woodland. Annie Griffiths Belt&#39;s evocative colour and hand-tinted photographs capture the essence of these diverse bioregions. The images take you from the tallgrass prairies of Kansas and Nevada to the Arctic tundra of Alaska, from the endangered coral reefs off the Florida Keys to the Pacific-pounded coast of Oregon, from the deserts of the Southwest to the sky-piercing redwoods of California.</p><p>In this coffee-table nature book, two ardent conservationists make an impassioned plea for the preservation of American wilderness, from sparkling seashores to pristine deserts. In her moving introduction, bestselling author Kingsolver laments the loss of untouched spaces. Like most ecologically minded people, she is an optimistic pessimist, predicting more of the same destruction but begging us to "find in ourselves the grace to do otherwise." Unfortunately, Belt's photographs-meant to bolster Kingsolver's words-can fall into greeting-card cliche. Her technique of using black-and-white infrared negative film for half the images and hand-coloring the prints results in blurred, pale pictures that share a pastel sameness. The more conventional photos are stunning, though, and Belt makes up for her experiment by capturing the essence of America the way we imagine it used to be. Kingsolver provides introductions to each of the sections devoted to broad biomes such as plains, wetlands and forests. With literary and photographic nods to the giants of conservation-Aldo Leopold, Henry David Thoreau, Edward Abbey and others-the book offers quiet evidence that there is still something better than a world where "children's adventures and glimpses of fox dwell only in books."

Initially imported by the Allies, the form also matched perfectly the prevailing mood of irony, objectivity and mistrust of the didactic. With the original German text running alongside English translations, this collection features stories from eight outstanding post-war authors including Heinrich B�ll, Ilse Aichinger and Reinhard Lettau which students will find both educational and engrossing. B�ll&#x2019;s opening story 'Pale Anna' follows a soldier returning home, his situation comparable to that of the writer in the first months of peace: he knows no-one and has few words not linked to painful memories. This poignant narrative is followed by a variety of tales representing the diversity of the time and including satires, explorations of private obsessions and experiments in form and language.</p><p></p><h2>Natural Meals In Minutes - High-Fiber, Low-Fat Meatless Storage Meals-in 30 Minutes or Less!</h2><p><i>Natural Meals In Minutes</i>.

This true-life detective story unveils the journey of a sacred text&#x20ac;&#x201d;the tenth-century annotated bible known as the Aleppo Codex&#x20ac;&#x201d;from its hiding place in a Syrian synagogue to the newly founded state of Israel. Based on Matti Friedman&#x20ac;&#x2122;s independent research, documents kept secret for fifty years, and personal interviews with key players, the book proposes a new theory of what happened when the codex left Aleppo, Syria, in the late 1940s and eventually surfaced in Jerusalem, mysteriously incomplete.The codex provides vital keys to reading biblical texts. By recounting its history, Friedman explores the once vibrant Jewish communities in Islamic lands and follows the thread into the present, uncovering difficult truths about how the manuscript was taken to Israel and how its most important pages went missing.

For a city to host a biennial today has colossal ramifications. This anthology on the art biennial gathers previously published seminal texts from around the world alongside commissioned contributions from the leading scholars, curators, critics and thinkers today--among them Carlos Basualdo, Daniel Buren, John Clark, Okwui Enwezor, Bruce Ferguson, Milena Hoegsberg, Ranjit Hoskote, Caroline A. Jones, Jakouba Konat�, Gerardo Mosquera and Rafal Niemojewski. Tracing the genealogy of the standard exhibition format--including biennials but also other recurrent exhibitions such as triennials and quadrennials--and examining some of the most famous examples of the twentieth and twenty-first century, from the Venice Biennale to the Johannesburg Biennial and the Havana Bienal to Documenta and the Asian biennials, this reader explores the artistic, theoretical, political and other ambitions of such large-scale exhibition projects. It is certain to be a vital resource for scholars, students, curators, artists and critics alike.</p><p></p><h2>The Lady in the Box</h2><p>It is wintertime in the city and freezing cold, but not everyone is inside and warm. Ben and his sister Lizzie know that there is a lady who lives outside in a box over a warm air vent. The children worry about the kind-looking lady, and begin sneaking food and clothes out of their apartment for her. Gently told and powerfully illustrated in rich hues, The Lady in the Box deals candidly with the issue of homelessness.</p><p>Recipient of the Cuffie Award for a book that best represents a social issue.The lady in the box looked hungry. It was Lizzie's idea to bring her food. I reminded Lizzie that we can't talk to strangers. Lizzie said we wouldn't talk to her. We'd just put some crackers and peanut butter next to her box. <p>The first time, we forgot the knife for putting peanut butter on the crackers. But she managed somehow. The next day the peanut butter jar was empty. </p><p>I thought she should eat food that was good for her. So I brought her two raw carrots, a bunch of celery, and an apple. </p><p>Lizzie said the lady in the box didn't have many teeth, not enough for chewing hard food. There were a couple of cans of soup in our kitchen cabinet. Cream of celery and vegetable noodle. Soft and mushy soups. Just right for someone without teeth. Lizzie thought vegetable noodle was better. I thought celery. We had a fight about it. Lizzie won. </p><p>We heated up the vegetable noodle soup and ran down the stairs fast to get it to her before the soup got cold. Then we ran home before Mama could tell we were up to something again. Mama says we are always up to something. </p><p>The store windows were all Christmasy. It got dark early and the nights were very cold. </p><p>The lady in the box didn't have warm-enough clothes. </p><p>We looked in our closets. On Lizzie's shelf was a big warm scarf with bright red flowers. </p><p>Lizzie said she didn't like the scarf because it was so itchy. </p><p>I wasn't so sure the lady in the box would like it either.

Vogel</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three. It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun. "The idea of falling like heroes on ceremonial battlefields," Ford Madox Ford remarked later, "was gone forever."

She is the author of the bestselling and award winning CATWINGS series. Three of Le Guin&#39;s titles have been finalists for The American Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, and among the many honors her writing has received are a National Book Award, five Hugo Awards, five Nebula Awards, and The Margaret A. Edwards Award. She lives in Oregon.The endearing winged cats who escaped the city to be cared for by two reliable country children (Catwings, 1988, etc.) make a third appearance in this tale of a self-important kitten from nearby who discovers that his true worth is not what he has supposed. Alexander--``the biggest, the strongest, and the loudest''--has never noticed that his sisters are ``quite tired of him,'' but when he sets out to explore the world he soon learns that his cocky preconceptions don't serve. The cow who says ``Moo'' instead of ``Mew'' is unconcerned when he corrects her; speeding trucks and rude dogs threaten; when he bolts up a tree, he can't climb down and his doting parents don't turn up to help. Enter youngest Catwing Jane, nearly mute because of an early trauma (her only words are ``Me'' and ``Hate''), to take Alexander to her home--where his parents and ``Owner'' turn out to be glad to let him stay. After Alexander cajoles and hectors Jane into confronting her fears and describing them with her first real words, the Catwings agree: Alexander is ``wonderful.'' Brief as it is, this is a deftly crafted bildungsroman. The book's small format and Schindler's delicate illustrations add to the enchantment. A first chapter book to charm both newly independent readers and their elders. (Fiction. 5-10) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This ancient, Jewish method for interpreting the Bible searches not for what is familiar but for what is unfamiliar, not for what's clear but for what's unclear, and then wrestles with the text, passionately, playfully, and reverently. Midrash views the Bible as one side of a conversation, started by God, containing an implicit invitation to keep the conversation going. Kunst invites the reader to explore Midrash for the first time through a conversation, at times humorous, reflective and poetic, offering practical suggestions for personal Midrash-making along the way.<br> To listen to an excerpt from The Burning Word, click here.<br> Click Here to listen to an interview with Judith Kunst</p></p><p>As a Christian writer with an ongoing interest in how language can shape one&#39;s faith, Judith M.

An award-winning poet, her work has appeared in The Atlantic, Poetry, Mars Hill Review, and many other publications, and she has been an editor, teacher, and adjunct professor. She lives in Stony Brook, New York with her husband and two children.Jewish Midrash is conversation with the Bible; dialoging, questioning, arguing, for "When the Torah was given at Sinai it came with thirteen methods of interpretation, and forty-nine arguments proving each item is correct and forty-nine arguements proving that it is not" (p. 41).<br>To write or speak a midrash one:<br>1. chooses a text<br>2. finds a question to ask<br>3. creates an imaginative answer<br>4. argues, expands, changes; in other words, edits<br>The Burning Word explores midrash as one way to playfully interpret, understand and use scripture in our daily lives. In Kunst's discovery of the power of the midrash, she writes of intimacy, reverence, curiosity, community, suffering, attention, imagination, creation, repetition, revelation, and truth.<br>I encourage church educators and ministers to read the chapter on curiosity: Moses and the burning bush and the importance of questions as a way of encountering God.<br>Children (all of us) ask questions because they are curious. Moses was caring for his sheep when he saw the burning bush and asked, "Why isn't the bush consumed?" Curiosity stopped him and he turned aside to look, to stand on holy ground and in so doing, God began a relationship with Moses.<br>I found much in Judith Kunst's The Burning Word to turn me aside to look and stand on holy ground, and in so doing, encounter Elohim, 'Our God of Creative Power."

Idiosyncratic, determined, and occasionally obsessed, gardeners have a lot to say about their outdoor passion. THE WRITER IN THE GARDEN brings together a host of writing gardeners and gardening writers reveling in their quirks, confessing their shortcomings, and sharing their experiences. Combing through a hundred years of garden writing, editor Jane Garmey has discovered some great contemporary works and rediscovered many classics: &#34;I am strongly of the opinion,&#34; declares Gertrude Jekyll, &#34;that the possession of a quantity of plants, however good the plants may be themselves and however ample their number, does not make a garden.&#34; &#34;It isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t like sweet disorder, but it has to be judiciously arranged,&#34; writes Vita Sackville-West. &#34;Gardeners are--let&#39;s face it--control freaks,&#34; Abby Adams admits. &#34;Who else would willingly spend his leisure hours wrestling weeds out of the ground, blithely making life or death decisions about living beings, moving earth from here to there, changing the course of waterways?&#34; Drawing on the work of more than fifty writers, THE WRITER IN THE GARDEN covers subjects ranging from the beauty of the garden to ornery weeds, the hazards of rare plant collecting, and the tribulations of inclement weather. The collection includes a range of authors from both sides of the Atlantic: from Edith Wharton, who insists that we could all learn a thing or two about design from the Italians, to Stephen Lacey, who reveals that his most exciting gardening moments are spent in the bath. Some of the other writers in the collection are: E. B. White, Beverly Nichols, Ken Druse, Eleanor Perenyi, W. S. Merwin, Mirabel Osler, Henry Mitchell, Jamaica Kincaid, Robert Dash, Sara B.

The famous writers of the past, like Vita Sackville-West, Gertrude Jekyll, Elizabeth von Arnim (author of <i>Enchanted April</i>), and Beverley Nichols rub shoulders with the garden columnists and book authors of today, such as longtime <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Henry Mitchell, Christopher Lloyd, and Ken Druse.<p> As all gardeners know, thinking about plants and gardens leads one to speculate about life, love, triumph and despair, obsession, and death. These authors cover it all, not just in metaphor, although they are expert at the well-turned phrase and the classic image, but in garden practicalities, too. Perhaps only in the best garden essay can the design of shovels, the number of worms in the soil, and raves about the newest kind of perennial co-exist comfortably with ruminations on mortality, the soul, and the nature of beauty. Lest this sound too serious, all is laced with humor; Henry Mitchell's hounds lie about the garden beds, crushing his latest peony, and Charles Kuralt complains about how he missed his favorite daffodil when CBS News had the nerve to send him to Moscow in April for an unfortunately scheduled summit conference.</p><p> "Half the interest of a garden is the constant exercise of the imagination," said Alice Morse Earle in 1897. We are fortunate that these writers had enough imagination to both garden and to write about it and that Jane Garmey had the imagination to gather such a variety of well-chosen garden voices. <i>--Valerie Easton</i></p>Edith Wharton, Under the Spell of evergreen foliage and stone, celebrates the magic of Italian gardens. Charles Kuralt waits on the bloom of a single daffodil like an expectant father. Gertrude Jekyll, after a month-long drought, praises the coming rain. Allen Tracy rails against hydrangeas.<p> Here is an engaging group of more than fifty gardening writers - and writing gardeners - reveling in their likes and dislikes, confessing their shortcomings, and sharing their successes and failures. The Writer in the Garden presents a colorful bouquet of prose and poetry from both sides of the Atlantic. With subjects ranging from an old-fashioned rose to ornery weeds, the hazards of rare plant collecting, and the tribulations of inclement weather, The Writer in the Garden brings together an entertaining selection of garden writing from the past one hundred years. From Thoreau to Jamaica Kincaid, the writers and gardeners here express the trials and joys of gardening in the country as well as the challenges and rewards of trying to make things grow in the city. But whether a garden is large or small, thriving or failing, every gardener has a story.</p><p> Bursting with personality, strong opinions, and bright ideas, The Writer in the Garden is a book to read and enjoy - season after season.</p><p></p></p><h2>If God Loves Me, Why Can&#39;t I Get My Locker Open?</h2><p>It&#39;s Time to Give God a Piece of Your Mind What&#39;s on your mind? Is it your biology final? Is it the fight you just had with your best friend? Is it Jesus? Staying close by Him is the best way to make it through this crazy life, but it can be hard to keep Jesus on your mind morning, noon, and night, especially when so many people think that being a Christian means you&#39;re weak, na�ve, or uncool. As a result, maybe you find yourself at the most exclusive parties just to prove that you&#39;re not the boring loser your classmates think you are. But you don&#39;t need to prove yourself to them, and here&#39;s why: God&#39;s opinion of you is the one that really matters. He is the only one who completely understands you, and He wants to help. This book, filled with enough devotionals for an entire year, equips you to hold fast to values like maintaining sexual purity, having a good work ethic, and being a great friend. Rediscover the power of God&#39;s love, and you&#39;ll remember why it was so important for you to stick by Him in the first place.</p><p>Lorraine Peterson has written several best selling devotionals for teens.

Sawyer. An alien shuttle craft lands outside the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. A six-legged, two-armed alien emerges, who says, in perfect English, "Take me to a paleontologist." <br>It seems that Earth, and the alien's home planet, and the home planet of another alien species traveling on the alien mother ship, all experienced the same five cataclysmic events at about the same time (one example of these "cataclysmic events" would be the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs). Both alien races believe this proves the existence of God: i.e. he's obviously been playing with the evolution of life on each of these planets.<br><br>From this provocative launch point, Sawyer tells a fast-paced, and morally and intellectually challenging, SF story that just grows larger and larger in scope. The evidence of God's universal existence is not universally well received on Earth, nor even immediately believed. And it reveals nothing of God's nature. In fact. it poses more questions than it answers.<br><br>When a supernova explodes out in the galaxy but close enough to wipe out life on all three home-worlds, the big question is, Will God intervene or is this the sixth cataclysm:?<br><br><i>Calculating God</i> is SF on the grand scale.&nbsp;<i>Calculating God</i> is a 2001 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.</p><p>Creationists rarely find sympathy in the ranks of science fiction authors--or fans, for that matter. And while Robert J. Sawyer doesn't exactly make peace with evangelicals on the issue, <i>Calculating God</i> has to be one of the more thoughtful and sympathetic SF portrayals you'll find of religion and intelligent design. But that should come as no surprise from this crafty Canadian: in the Nebula Award-winning <i>Terminal Experiment</i>, Sawyer speculated on what would happen if hard evidence were ever found for the human soul; in <i>Calculating God</i>, he turns science on its head again when earth is invaded by theists from outer space.<p> The book starts out like the setup for some punny science fiction joke: An alien walks into a museum and asks if he can see a paleontologist. But the arachnid ET hasn't come aboard a rowboat with the Pope and Stephen Hawking (although His Holiness does request an audience later). Landing at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the spacefarer (named Hollus) asks to compare notes on mass extinctions with resident dino-scientist Thomas Jericho. A shocked Jericho finds that not only does life exist on other planets, but that every civilization in the galaxy has experienced extinction events at precisely the same time. Armed with that disconcerting information (and a little help from a grand unifying theory), the alien informs Jericho, almost dismissively, that "the primary goal of modern science is to discover why God has behaved as he has and to determine his methods."</p><p> Inventive, fast-paced, and alternately funny and touching, <i>Calculating God</i> sneaks in a well-researched survey of evolution science, exobiology, and philosophy amidst the banter between Hollus and Jericho. But the book also proves to be very moving and character-driven SF, as Jericho--in the face of Hollus's convincing arguments--grapples with his own bitter reasons for not believing in God. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Robert J.

Mark Cousins&#39;s chronological journey through the worldwide history of film is told from the point of view of filmmakers and moviegoers. Weaving personalities, film technology, and production with engaging descriptions of groundbreaking scenes, Cousins uses his experience as film historian, producer, and director to capture the shifting trends of movie history. We learn how filmmakers influenced each other; how contemporary events influenced them; how they challenged established techniques and developed new technologies to enhance their medium. Striking images reinforce the reader&#39;s understanding of cinematic innovation, both stylistic and technical. The images reveal astonishing parallels in global filmmaking, thus introducing the less familiar worlds of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern cinema, as well as documenting the fortunes of the best Western directors. The Story of Film presents Silent (1885-1928), Sound (1928-1990), and Digital (1990-present), spanning the birth of the moving image; the establishment of Hollywood; the European avant-garde movements, personal filmmaking; world cinema; and recent phenomena like Computer Generated Imagery and the ever-more &#34;real&#34; realizations of the wildest of imaginations. The Story of Film explores what has today become the world&#39;s most popular artistic medium.</p><p>Mark Cousins is Honorary Lecturer in Film and Media Studies at the University of Stirling and teaches The Aesthetics of World Cinema at Edinburgh College of Art.</p><h2>The Star Wars Encyclopedia</h2><p>Its vast history and environs have been explored, studied, and chronicled extensively for more than twenty years. Now, this landmark volume--a definitive reference devoted exclusively to the Star Wars milieu--draws together data from films, radio dramas, novels, short stories, computer games, and more, running the full gamut of this extraordinary galaxy. <br><br>From science and technology to history and geography; from culture and biography to ecology and cosmology; from "abo" and "Abrax" to "zwil" and "Zirtran's Anchor," this all-encompassing, fully illustrated, alphabetical reference covers all the elements which have developed and expanded the Star Wars universe, creating a rich and diverse history that spans millennia. Its scope ranges from the renowned and infamous ("Luke Skywalker," "Darth Vader") to the obscure and enigmatic ("Tnun Bdu"); from the history of the Sith Wars to the Galactic Civil War that pit the Rebel Alliance against the Empire. It introduces us to the natives and customs of planets as diverse as Tatooine and Dagobah, and even to the secrets and beliefs of the Jedi Knights.<br><br>As a bonus for the intensive researcher, this massive reference includes the complete timeline of major events in Star Wars history.<br><br>Every key element that exists in the world of Star Wars is supplied here--in clearly defined entries that have been researched and written by one of the leading authorities on the Star Wars universe.</p><p>Since 1977, the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, conceived by George Lucas, has been explored by authors and artists eager to build on the foundation laid by the blockbuster movies. <i>The Star Wars Encyclopedia</i> is the essential guide to every detail of the history, planets, vehicles, politics, aliens, and weapons described in countless books, comics, stories, and (of course) movies. You'll find extraordinary details about old favorites here--for instance, did you know that Luke Skywalker helped rescue Han and Leia's children from the dark side of the Force? Or that the primary food of Jawas is the hubba gourd? Endless hours of browsing pleasure await you, from A-1 Deluxe Floater (a luxury air speeder) to ZZ-4Z (Han Solo's housekeeping droid). Each item is cross-referenced to the book, movie, or comic in which it appears, but fans looking for "real-life" information about the <i>Star Wars</i> phenomenon won't find it here--this is strictly a resource for those who want to keep track of how all the stories and characters fit together, the clothes they wear, the foods they eat, and the planets they call home. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Stephen J.

The point of view and adventures of a former SS officer (Dr. Max Aue) seem at first sight merely technical artifacts to allow the reader the details of several aspects of the Nazi era and the author's thorough knowledge and research of specifics of the period. These range from the bureaucratic struggles and turf wars within the different power spheres within the Nazi regime, the role of police units in the east behind the front lines, Wehrmacht-SS disputes, the military operations in the Caucasus, the linguistic and migratory histories of the Caucasian peoples, the Red Army rampage in East Prussia and the bombing of the Reich, the debauchery in the closing days of the war, music and homosexuality through nazi ideology, the question of how far did society know or wish to know about the atrocities, among many other topics. The most striking aspect in the treatment of these issues is, however, the dark veil of Nazi ideology. The narrative seems to seek the proof that Nazism permeated almost every endeavor of military and social life in World War II Germany, and it succeeds doing so.<br><br>In parallel to these quasi-historical narratives flows the personal life of Dr. Aue. In these episodes the grip of the author is somewhat less convincing and blunter, implying that deep personal psychological disturbances have had to be at the root of the Nazi evil. The closing paragraph in the book provides a sharp and dramatic ending, putting treachery to the human spirit as the final driver of Nazi ideology.</p><p>Jonathan Littell was born in New York to American parents, and grew up in the United States and France.

The late Jacen Solo&#x2019;s shocking transformation into murderous Sith Lord Darth Caedus has cast a damning pall over those who wield the Force for good: Two Jedi Knights have succumbed to an inexplicable and dangerous psychosis, criminal charges have driven Luke Skywalker into self-imposed exile, and power-hungry Chief of State Natasi Daala is exploiting anti-Jedi sentiment to undermine the Order&#x2019;s influence within the Galactic Alliance. <br><br> Forbidden to intervene in Jedi affairs, Luke is on a desperate mission to uncover the truth behind Jacen&#x2019;s fall to the dark side&#x2013;and to learn what&#x2019;s turning peaceful Jedi into raving lunatics. But finding answers will mean venturing into the mind-bending space of the Kathol Rift and bargaining with an alien species as likely to destroy outsiders as deal with them. Still, there is no other choice and no time to lose, as the catastrophic events on Coruscant continue to escalate. Stricken by the same violent dementia that infected her brother, Valin, Jedi Knight Jysella Horn faces an equally grim fate after her capture by Natasi Daala&#x2019;s police. And when Han and Leia Solo narrowly foil another deranged Jedi bent on deadly destruction, even acting Jedi Grand Master Kenth Hamner appears willing to bow to Daala&#x2019;s iron will&#x2013;at the expense of the Jedi Order.<br><br>But an even greater threat is looming. Millennia in the past, a Sith starship crashed on an unknown low-tech planet, leaving the survivors stranded. Over the generations, their numbers have grown, the ways of the dark side have been nurtured, and the time is fast approaching when this lost tribe of Sith will once more take to the stars to reclaim their legendary destiny as rulers of the galaxy. Only one thing stands in their way, a name whispered to them through the Force: <i>Skywalker.</i></p><p>Christie Golden is the award-winning author of more than thirty novels and several short stories in the fields of fantasy, science fiction, and horror.

While the sun was bright&nbsp;and warm, a breeze came from the sea to cool the&nbsp;heated faces of the two figures standing there.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;They faced each other, as still as if they were carved&nbsp;from stone, the only motion around them that of their&nbsp;hair and heavy black robes as the wind toyed with&nbsp;them.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then, as if by some unheard signal, one of them&nbsp;moved. The soft sound of the ocean was punctuated by&nbsp;a sharp <i>snap- hiss. </i>The almost perfectly symmetrical,&nbsp;light purple features of Vestara Khai&#x2019;s adversary were&nbsp;abruptly cast into sickly green relief. Vestara activated&nbsp;her own weapon with a fluid motion, saluted her opponent&nbsp;with it, settled into position, and waited to see&nbsp;who would make the first move. She balanced lightly&nbsp;on the balls of her booted feet, ready to leap left, right,&nbsp;or straight up. Still her opponent did not move.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The sun was at its height and its light was harsh,&nbsp;beating down on them like something physical. Their&nbsp;heavy dark robes were stifling hot, but Vestara would&nbsp;no sooner abandon her robes than she would abandon&nbsp;her weapon or her heritage. The robes were traditional,&nbsp;ancient, a deep and valued part of who she was, and she&nbsp;would endure the encumbrance. The Tribe valued&nbsp;strength as much as it valued beauty; rewarded patience&nbsp;as much as initiative. The wise being was the one who&nbsp;knew when which was called for.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara sprang.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Not at her opponent, but to the left and past him,&nbsp;leaping upward, turning in the air, and slashing outward&nbsp;with the blade. She felt the blade impact and&nbsp;heard its distinctive sizzle. He gasped as she landed,&nbsp;flipped, and crouched back into a defensive position.&nbsp;The sandy surface was treacherous, and her foot&nbsp;slipped. She righted herself almost instantly, but that&nbsp;moment was all he needed to come at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He hammered her with blows that were more of&nbsp;strength than grace, his lithe body all lean muscle. She&nbsp;parried each strike, the blades clashing and sizzling, and&nbsp;ducked underneath the final one. Lightness and agility&nbsp;were her allies, and she used them freely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Her long, light brown hair had come loose from its&nbsp;quickly twisted braid, and the tendrils were a distraction.&nbsp;She blew upward to clear her vision just in time to&nbsp;block another one of the strong blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Blast,� she muttered, leaping back and switching the&nbsp;blade to her other hand. She was completely ambidextrous.&nbsp;�You&#x2019;re getting good, Ahri.�&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ahri Raas, apprentice, member of the native&#x2013; and&nbsp;conquered&#x2013; species of Keshiri and Vestara Khai&#x2019;s close&nbsp;friend, offered her a smile. �I&#x2019;d say the same about you,&nbsp;Ves, except for the fact that that sand- jump messes you&nbsp;up every single ti&#x2013;�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She interrupted him with a sudden upward leap, landing&nbsp;on his shoulders, balancing there lightly with the use&nbsp;of the Force, and plunged the lightsaber straight downward,&nbsp;aiming for his back between his shoulder blades.&nbsp;He dived forward, Force- pushing her off, but not before&nbsp;she had touched the tip of the glowing red blade to&nbsp;his robes. Ahri arched, his dive thrown off as his body&nbsp;twisted from the pain; even the training lightsabers inflicted&nbsp;a powerful shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara leapt as Ahri dived, using his Force push to&nbsp;her own advantage, turning twice in the air and landing&nbsp;surely, facing him. She smirked in satisfaction as she&nbsp;brushed her renegade locks out of the way. Ahri completed&nbsp;his dive and came to his feet, rolling in the sand.&nbsp;Vestara extended her arm with the grace of a dancer.&nbsp;Ahri&#x2019;s lightsaber was snatched from his hand and flew&nbsp;into hers. She grasped it and dropped into the Jar&#x2019;Kai&nbsp;stance, ready to come at him with both blades. Ahri&nbsp;looked up and sighed, dropping back into the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�And you get distracted far too easily. Focus, Ahri,&nbsp;focus,� she chided. She gestured casually, just a slight&nbsp;jerk of her chin, and a handful of sand flew toward&nbsp;Ahri&#x2019;s face. Muttering, he lifted his empty hand and&nbsp;used the Force to deflect the grains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�It&#x2019;s just training, Ves,� he muttered, getting to his&nbsp;feet and dusting himself off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�It&#x2019;s <i>never </i>just training,� she shot back. She deactivated&nbsp;her training lightsaber, hooked it back on her&nbsp;belt, and tossed Ahri&#x2019;s to him. The Keshiri youth caught&nbsp;it easily, still looking disgruntled. Vestara undid her&nbsp;hair and fluffed it for a minute, letting the air penetrate&nbsp;to the roots to cool her scalp. Her long fingers busily rebraided&nbsp;it, properly this time, as she continued to&nbsp;speak, while Ahri shook grains of purple sand out of&nbsp;his own white, shoulder- length hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�How often have I told you that? Say that in the presence&nbsp;of one of the Masters and you&#x2019;ll never make it beyond&nbsp;a Tyro.�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ahri sighed and rose, nodding to acknowledge the&nbsp;truth of what she said. Neither of them had been formally&nbsp;chosen as an apprentice yet, although they had&nbsp;been training in classes under the tutelage of various&nbsp;Masters for years, their strengths and weaknesses in the&nbsp;Force noted and analyzed and pushed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara knew that, at fourteen, it was still possible,&nbsp;even likely, that she would be chosen by a Master as his&nbsp;or her formal apprentice. But she chafed horribly at the&nbsp;delay. Some Tyros were chosen at much younger ages,&nbsp;and Vestara knew that she was strong in the Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She reached out for a flask of now warm water and&nbsp;the canteen resting on the sand floated to her, the lid unfastening&nbsp;as it moved. Vestara gulped down the liquid&nbsp;thirstily. Sparring at the height of the sun was exhausting,&nbsp;and Ahri always muttered about it, but she knew it&nbsp;toughened her. Vestara handed the canteen to Ahri,&nbsp;who also drank.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;She regarded him for a moment. He was a nearly perfect&nbsp;physical specimen of a species whose physical strength,&nbsp;agility, and harmony of features and form had become&nbsp;an ideal for her own people. He could easily pass for a&nbsp;member of her own species&#x2013; he would make a striking&nbsp;human, but a human nonetheless&#x2013; were it not for the&nbsp;pale purple cast to his skin. His eyes, too, were slightly&nbsp;larger than a human&#x2019;s; large and expressive. His shoulders&nbsp;were broad, his hips narrow, and there was not an&nbsp;ounce of superfluous fat on his frame. His face,&nbsp;though, was flushed a darker purple than usual because&nbsp;he was overheated, and his hair had far too&nbsp;much sand in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�That&#x2019;s two for two,� she said. �You up for another&nbsp;round?� She gave him a wicked grin, which was exaggerated&nbsp;by the small scar at the corner of her mouth.&nbsp;<br><br>The scar that the Tribe saw as a flaw. It was plain on her&nbsp;face, right out in the open&#x2013;there was very little she&nbsp;could do to disguise it. Attempts had been made to heal&nbsp;it and to correct it with cosmetic surgery. Those attempts&nbsp;had been mostly successful and now, to be sure,&nbsp;it was not all that noticeable. But this was a world&nbsp;where any flaw, any scar or deformity, was a strike&nbsp;against one&#x2019;s potential for advancement.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The scar added insult to injury, as far as Vestara was&nbsp;concerned&#x2013; because of its location, the thin line almost&nbsp;always made her look like she was smiling, even when&nbsp;she wasn&#x2019;t. She had hated that about it until Lady&nbsp;Rhea, one of the most respected of the Sith Lords, had&nbsp;told her that deception was actually a very useful thing&nbsp;indeed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;�It mars your beauty,� Lady Rhea had said bluntly,&nbsp;pausing as she strolled down the line of potential apprentices&nbsp;after a formal ceremony. �A pity.� She, whose&nbsp;beauty was only slightly diminished by the cruel ravages&nbsp;of time, reached out a long finger and touched the&nbsp;scar. �But this little scar&#x2013; it can aid you. Make others&nbsp;think you are <i>something you are not.</i>� She tapped the&nbsp;scar lightly with each of the last four words, emphasizing&nbsp;her point.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;That had made Vestara feel a bit better. All of a sudden,&nbsp;looking like she was smiling all the time, even&nbsp;when she wasn&#x2019;t, seemed like a good thing to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�I think I&#x2019;ve sweated off at least two liters already,�&nbsp;Ahri replied. �Can&#x2019;t we continue in the training courtyard&nbsp;at least? It&#x2019;s cooler in the mountain shadows.�&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;At least he wasn&#x2019;t refusing the offer of another round.&nbsp;Vestara dragged a black- draped arm across her own&nbsp;forehead. She had to admit, fighting in the cool shadows&nbsp;of the proud columns, beautiful statuary, and sheer&nbsp;mountain stone in which the Temple courtyard was&nbsp;nestled had a definite appeal right at the moment.&nbsp;While they were not yet formally apprenticed to any of&nbsp;the Sabers or the Masters, as Tyros they would be per-&nbsp;mitted to spar in the courtyard. That was as far as they&nbsp;were allowed to go, however. Neither of them had seen&nbsp;inside the Temple or, even more significant, inside the&nbsp;Ship of Destiny yet. The ship&#x2019;s name was <i>Omen, </i>but the&nbsp;name �Ship of Destiny� had fallen into common usage.&nbsp;For such it was. Such an ancient, precious part of the&nbsp;Tribe&#x2019;s heritage, with all its secrets and mysteries, was&nbsp;not just for any eyes.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;�Well,� Vestara said, �we can go back and finish&nbsp;there. But only because you&#x2019;re too fragile to&#x2013;�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Her teasing insult died in her throat as something&nbsp;passed over the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was not an uvak, one of the deceptively delicate&nbsp;winged reptiles that were used for aerial transportation.&nbsp;Vestara&#x2019;s dark brown eyes widened in shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Ves,� Ahri said in a faint voice, �that&#x2019;s . . . is that a&nbsp;<i>ship</i>?�&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The hairs on her arms and the back of her neck stood&nbsp;on end despite the heat as she watched, lifting a hand to&nbsp;shade her eyes. She still couldn&#x2019;t speak, but nodded. She&nbsp;was pretty sure that was exactly what the thing in the&nbsp;sky was.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Yet it looked nothing like the Ship of Destiny, or any&nbsp;other vessels she had seen depicted or heard described.&nbsp;Rather than being long and rectangular, or V- shaped, it&nbsp;was a symmetrical sphere. With . . . with wings like an&nbsp;uvak. It moved swiftly and silently, and she now saw&nbsp;that its color was a dark orange- red. Closer and closer&nbsp;it came, until for a wild moment Vestara thought it was&nbsp;going to land right on the beach beside them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was coming in for a landing, certainly, but not quite&nbsp;so close as that. It was heading for the sharp, ridged&nbsp;mountains that seemed to spring up from the ocean itself.&nbsp;That was where the Ship of Destiny had crashed so&nbsp;long ago, and for a moment Vestara was alarmed that&nbsp;this vessel would suffer the same fate. Sudden worry&nbsp;suffused her. It couldn&#x2019;t! She had to know who was inside,&nbsp;what sort of beings they were. Perhaps they were&nbsp;a species she had never before encountered. The&nbsp;thought was thrilling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As it passed over, its shadow fell across her for an instant.&nbsp;A sensation of coldness, much more than the expected&nbsp;sudden coolness of something blocking direct&nbsp;sunlight, brushed Vestara. She gasped slightly as the&nbsp;feeling tingled through her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was cold, yes, forbidding . . . but also challenging.&nbsp;Curious. Intrigued.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>By <i>her.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br><br>She no longer was afraid for the vessel&#x2019;s safety. Its&nbsp;pilot knew exactly what it was doing. It was heading&nbsp;directly and quite deliberately for the ruins of the Ship&nbsp;of Destiny, and the Temple, almost as old, that had&nbsp;been constructed around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Any fear or trepidation she had experienced a moment&nbsp;before evaporated like water on a hot rock. Vestara&nbsp;reached out in the Force and summoned Tikk, her&nbsp;uvak. Tikk had been basking in the sunlight, craving&nbsp;the heat as all reptiles did, his sharp beak and brilliant&nbsp;green eyes closed. Now he lifted his bright gold head,&nbsp;stretched out his long neck, and spread his red- andblack&nbsp;ruff in the uvak equivalent of an awakening&nbsp;stretch. With an answering croak, he spread his wings,&nbsp;leapt upward, and flew the few meters toward Vestara&nbsp;and Ahri.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She barely paid attention to Tikk, keeping her eyes&nbsp;glued to the strange vessel as it grew smaller and finally&nbsp;vanished from her sight. When she could see it no&nbsp;longer, Vestara took a deep, steadying breath, then&nbsp;gathered up the long hem of her robes, turned to where&nbsp;Tikk patiently awaited her, and began to run as fast as&nbsp;her long legs would carry her in the cumbersome sand,&nbsp;using the Force to stabilize her feet and push her along.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Come on,� she called over her shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�Where are we going?� asked Ahri, hastening to&nbsp;catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Vestara Force- leapt upward, landing gracefully on the&nbsp;broad back of the uvak. Ahri followed suit, his arms&nbsp;slipping around her waist as he sat behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�To follow the ship,� Vestara said. �Couldn&#x2019;t you feel&nbsp;it? It was for us, Ahri.�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Tikk gathered himself, shifting his weight from one&nbsp;clawed foot to the other, then sprang upward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�For us?� Ahri shouted over the beat of the membranous,&nbsp;veined wings&#x2013; wings so very like those of the vessel&nbsp;that had brushed Vestara&#x2019;s thoughts only a few&nbsp;heartbeats earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>�For us,� Vestara repeated firmly. She didn&#x2019;t know&nbsp;how she knew, only that she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The vessel had come for them. For younglings. For&nbsp;apprentices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It had come for Sith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was not a very great distance as an uvak flew to the&nbsp;Sith Temple. Accessible only from the air or by a perilous&nbsp;climb, the Temple had been created to protect and&nbsp;watch over the Ship of Destiny and house the survivors&nbsp;of the crash. Vestara had visited here many times before,&nbsp;ever since she had become a Tyro. But she was&nbsp;more excited now than she had been even on her first&nbsp;trip so long ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Tikk&#x2019;s leathery wings beat steadily, and the Temple&nbsp;came into view. It had been hewn from the very rock&nbsp;that had been the destruction of the Ship of Destiny&#x2013;&nbsp;the <i>Omen. </i>It was very much like the Sith, Vestara&nbsp;thought, to take that which had been responsible for&nbsp;their greatest hardship and make it serve them.

Tour.</p><p>Born into the prominent, puritanical Peabody family, Marietta Tree (1917-91) retained her forebears&#39; dedication to public service while adding a taste for sexual and social adventure. She held posts at the United Nations and was a dedicated supporter of civil rights and other liberal causes. But she was better known as a fabulous hostess and social butterfly whose two disappointing marriages did not stand in the way of affairs with men as dissimilar as Adlai Stevenson and John Huston. Caroline Seebohm, whose previous books include a zippy biography of magazine mogul Conde Nast, does justice to Tree&#39;s busy life in a lively text crowded with incident.The woman who emerges from this biography is a kind of classy Pamela Harriman--certainly not the image Marietta Peabody Tree, a minister's daughter and a Peabody of Massachusetts, envisioned for herself. That the two would be compared is inescapable--both blossomed in the interval between the world wars, both chose first husbands who would lift them from an imprisoning lifestyle, both subsequently married money that set them on paths to personal fulfillment as US ambassadors (Harriman to France, Tree to the UN), and both had celebrated and affluent lovers. Seebohm (The Man Who Was Vogue, 1982, etc.) staves off these comparisons, offering instead a chronological narrative that depends heavily on Tree's glamorous appointment books. That includes the era when Tree's first husband, Desmond FitzGerald, was at war (WW II) and she was a researcher for Time magazine; she represented liberal labor on the Newspaper Guild and high society on the limousine- liberal party circuit, and had an affair with actor/director John Huston. She divorced FitzGerald, married Ronald Tree, whose money was in America and whose heart was in England. Their marriage lasted until he died, during which time she established herself in the inner circles of the Democratic Party (politics being always her first love) and began a relationship with Adlai Stevenson that lasted until he died, literally, at her feet. She was an absent--and perhaps envious--mother of two famous daughters, Pulitzer Prize winner Frances FitzGerald and supermodel Penelope Tree. She died in 1991 of cancer, whose progress she hid from all but Frances, as she continued to party and attend meetings until shortly before her death. Too much emphasis on celebrity guest lists and the houses, dresses, and servants that money could buy override the very real courage that Tree and her generation demonstrated in demanding to lead their own lives.

Don&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas &nbsp;Fleming) and <i>Civil War Wives</i> (&#x201c;Utterly fresh . . . Sensitive, poignant, thoroughly fascinating.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jay Winik), here is the remarkable life of Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, renowned as the most beautiful woman of nineteenth-century Baltimore, whose marriage in 1803 to J�r�me Bonaparte, the youngest brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, became inextricably bound to the diplomatic and political<b> </b>histories of the United States, France, and England.<br><br>In<i> Wondrous Beauty</i>, Carol Berkin tells the story of this audacious, outsized life. We see how the news of the union infuriated Napoleon and resulted in his banning the then �pregnant Betsy Bonaparte from disembarking in any European port, offering his brother the threat of remaining married to that &#x201c;American girl&#x201d; and forfeiting all wealth and power&#x2014;or renouncing her, marrying a woman of Napoleon&#x2019;s choice, and reaping the benefits.<br><br>J�r�me ended the marriage posthaste and was made king of Westphalia; Betsy fled to England, gave birth to her son and only child, J�r�me&#x2019;s namesake, and was embraced by the English press, who boasted that their nation had opened its arms to the cruelly abandoned young wife. <br><br>Berkin writes that this na�ve, headstrong American girl returned to Baltimore a wiser, independent woman, refusing to seek social redemption or a return to obscurity through a quiet marriage to a member of Baltimore&#x2019;s merchant class. Instead she was courted by many, indifferent to all, and initiated a dangerous game of politics&#x2014;a battle for a pension from Napoleon&#x2014;which she won: her pension from the French government arrived each month until Napoleon&#x2019;s exile. <br><br>Using Betsy Bonaparte&#x2019;s extensive letters, the author makes clear that the &#x201c;belle of Baltimore&#x201d; disdained America&#x2019;s obsession with moneymaking, its growing ethos of democracy, and its rigid gender roles that confined women to the parlor and the nursery; that she sought instead a European society where women created salons devoted to intellectual life&#x2014;where she was embraced by many who took into their confidence, such as Madame de Sta�l, Madame R�camier, the aging Marquise de Villette (goddaughter of Voltaire), among others&#x2014;and &nbsp;where aristocracy, based on birth and breeding rather than commerce, dominated society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><i>Wondrous Beauty</i> is a riveting portrait of a woman torn between two worlds, unable to find peace in either&#x2014;one a provincial, convention-bound new America; the other a sophisticated, extravagant Old World Europe that embraced freedoms, a Europe ultimately swallowed up by decadence and idleness. <br>A stunning revelation of an extraordinary age.</p><p>Carol Berkin received her A.B. from Barnard College and her M.A. and Ph.D. from Columbia University.

She lives in New York City and Guilford, Connecticut.Chapter One <br><br>&#x201c;She Is a Most Extraordinary Girl&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte&#x2019;s story began, as so many American stories still do, with an immigrant&#x2019;s arrival. The man who would become Elizabeth&#x2019;s father, William Patterson, was a perfect example of the economic opportunities the new republic promised and sometimes delivered. He arrived in Philadelphia in 1766, a penniless fourteen-year-old, a Scots-Irish castaway from that poorest of British possessions, Ireland. But what he lacked in education or family wealth, he made up for in raw ambition and keen business sense. As an apprentice in a countinghouse, he did not waste time, as many of his peers did, drinking or playing cards after hours; instead, he sought the company of older men, established merchants who could add to his knowledge of the buying, shipping, and selling of goods. He kept a keen eye out for the main chance, scrimping and saving while he waited for fortune to smile on him. His first good luck came in the form of the American Revolution.<br><br>William had no interest in enlisting in the army as many young men would soon do. Indeed, throughout his life he boasted that he had none of the civic pride that drove poor men to military service or rich men to philanthropy. As war approached, he wanted neither glory nor adventure. He wanted wealth and respectability. And he reckoned that a man who invested his money in the purchase and sale of European arms and ammunition could acquire both. At twenty-two, William Patterson risked his entire savings on shares in two vessels headed to France to purchase the weapons that the American army so desperately needed. Where his money went, William was determined to go as well, and thus the budding entrepreneur took passage in one of the ships.<br><br>On the return voyage, which carried the ships first to the West Indies, fortune smiled on William once again. Here, on foreign-owned islands like the Dutch St. Eustatius, military supplies could be warehoused before final sale and shipment to the American forces. A fine profit could be made for the middlemen in this process, and William meant to make it. His two ships sailed home, but Patterson remained in the Caribbean for eighteen months. With remarkable speed, his fortune grew, and so did his rejection of the risk-taking attitude that had begun his climb up the economic ladder.<br><br>In truth, by the age of twenty-five, Patterson had become that oxymoron, a cautious entrepreneur. He had worked hard to acquire his fortune, and he intended to keep it all. A strong fatalist streak ran through his philosophy: men could fall as quickly as they could rise, and the man who owned a mansion was only one foolish or impetuous step away from the beggar outside its doors. He did not plan to wind up on the outside looking in ever again.<br><br>By July 1778, William was ready to go home. But he did not head for Philadelphia; instead he made his way to the growing city of Baltimore, Maryland. Here, where he would live for the rest of his life, William began a pursuit of respectability and social status with the same steely ambition that had formerly marked his pursuit of wealth. Although his own parents had been Church of England, he joined the local Presbyterian church, for its pews were filled with the merchant elite of Baltimore. He built a fine brick home, and beside it he constructed his countinghouse. He took a final step to the gentility he craved&#x2014;and believed he had earned&#x2014;by marrying Dorcas Spear, a beautiful young woman with impeccable family credentials.<br><br>In choosing Dorcas as his wife, William had not allowed sentiment or affection to cloud his judgment. Despite the romantic revolution swirling around him that led genteel young men and women to seek a marriage built on affection and companionship, he saw wedlock as a simple matter of enhancing or consolidating economic or social advantage. What Dorcas thought of her new husband is unknown, for she left no record of her courtship or of her own motives for the marriage. But it is clear that she was many things William was not: cultured, well educated, socially secure. Through blood and marriage, she was related to elite families in Virginia and Maryland, to revolutionary war officers and capital city political figures. And in temperament, she must surely have been patient and forgiving, for William proved a difficult man to live with and a faithless one at that.<br><br>By the time William and Dorcas said their vows, the bridegroom was numbered among the leading merchants and shippers not simply of Baltimore but of the new nation. He was intensely proud of his success, and it was a badge of honor that he was a self-made man. &#x201c;What I possess,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;is solely the product of my own labor. I inherited nothing of my forefathers, nor have I benefitted anything from public favors or appointments.&#x201d; His journey from rags to riches had come with a price, however. William&#x2019;s ambition, perseverance, and capacity for delayed gratification in everything but sexuality had calcified into a near obsession with security, a rigidity of thought, and a brittle sense of moral superiority. He valued practicality above sentimentality and found it easier to express disapproval than affection.<br><br>As a husband and a parent, William Patterson settled firmly into the role of patriarch. He expected not only obedience from all members of his family but also their confirmation of his wisdom in any situation. He was, in his own way, devoted to that family, but he could comprehend no other way to demonstrate his love than to control the lives of all who bore his name. He ruled his household with an iron fist that he believed to be a velvet glove.<br><br>William had strong, and unshakable, convictions about appropriate male and female roles in his family and in the larger society. For him, these roles were fixed and immutable. Men belonged in the broader public world of business and politics; women belonged in the home, where their lives were to revolve around the wishes and needs of husband or father. Other men might accept some latitude in the actual day-to-day compliance by their wives and daughters. Some might even delight in spirited or competent daughters as well as sons. But William was an absolutist. In this respect, he bore more resemblance to a fellow self-made man, a Frenchman named Napoleon, than to his American peers. &#x201c;We treat women too well,&#x201d; the Corsican soldier would observe when he became emperor, &#x201c;and in this way we have spoiled everything. We have done wrong in raising them to our level. Truly the Oriental nations have more mind and sense than we in declaring the wife to be the actual property of the husband.&#x201d;<br><br>Dorcas Spear Patterson would surely have disagreed with Napoleon that women were treated too well. Hers could not have been a happy life, for of her thirteen children, several died in childhood. And despite her submission to a domineering husband, she did not have the satisfaction of knowing that he honored his marriage vows. A string of mistresses, often drawn from the housekeeping staff, reflected his cavalier attitude toward marital fidelity; in 1814, as Dorcas lay dying, William would bring his current mistress into the household, no doubt to console him for the loss of a dutiful wife.<br><br>Dorcas&#x2019;s first daughter, Elizabeth Spear Patterson, was born on February 6, 1785. Elizabeth, or Betsy, and her country would grow up together, but from her earliest years, this child of the young republic would steadfastly refuse to embrace America&#x2019;s cultural and social trajectory. In part, this was the legacy of her mother&#x2019;s marital experience. The unhappiness that Betsy saw in the Patterson home seared into her consciousness the high cost of the social assumption that, in a proper household, a wife&#x2019;s duty was to please her husband and to spend a life confined to the parlor and the nursery. Betsy&#x2019;s devotion to her mother did not blind her to Dorcas&#x2019;s passive acceptance of her fate. She would carry a lock of Dorcas&#x2019;s hair with her all her life, but she would also carry her childhood memory of a woman bullied and scorned by her husband.<br><br>Dorcas had, however, played a second, more positive role in forging Betsy&#x2019;s rejection of American culture. For in her one rebellion against William Patterson, Dorcas Spear Patterson imparted to her daughter a deep appreciation of the arts, literature, and social refinement&#x2014;an appreciation entirely foreign to her husband. Thus while others might find the vitality and expansiveness of the young republic exciting or satisfying, while they might praise the energy of its moneymaking or the fecundity of its women, Betsy came to see only a country that was raw and crass, devoid of any appreciation of high culture, its leading lights as dull-witted as its dock workers.<br><br>Betsy dreamed of an alternative, an escape from the culture into which she had been born. She found it, at least in her young imagination, across the ocean in the aristocratic world of Europe. Friends and neighbors, politicians and public opinion makers might condemn the Old World as stagnant and decadent, but in Betsy&#x2019;s vision, it was sophisticated and glamorous. Her romantic notions of the charms of Europe may have been fostered by the presence in Baltimore of a number of French �migr�s and refugees, for the city&#x2019;s Catholic tradition acted as a magnet to Royalists fleeing the Terror, to displaced Acadians, and to the many white families uprooted by St. Dominique&#x2019;s slave revolts in the 1790s. The arrival of these French immigrants swelled the population of this Maryland port city and increased its prosperity. It also gave Betsy a glimpse of a culture very different from her own.<br><br>When she was ten, Betsy became far more familiar with the local French culture. That year her mother enrolled her at Madame Lacomb&#x2019;s school, where she mastered the French language. This fluency gave her entr�e into the city&#x2019;s immigrant community. She formed a close relationship with Henrietta Pascault, daughter of one of Baltimore&#x2019;s most cultured refugees, the Marquis de Poleon. For Betsy, the refined manners and sparkling sociability she witnessed in Madame&#x2019;s presence and in the Pascault household stood in sharp contrast to the somber atmosphere she found at home.<br><br>Indeed, for Betsy, the Patterson home was more prison than refuge. Her father watched over his children&#x2019;s lives with hawklike concentration. He was unapologetic about his close supervision of everyone under his roof, including his adult unmarried sons. &#x201c;I always considered it a duty to my family to keep them as much as possible under my own eye,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;so that I have seldom in my life left home whether on business or pleasure.&#x201d; His rule, he added, was to &#x201c;be the last up at night, and to see that the fires and lights were secured before I retired myself; from which I found two advantages: one was that there was little or no risk of fire under my own roof, and the other that it induced my family to keep regular hours.&#x201d; For William Patterson, sons and daughters, like lamps and fireplaces, were property under his care and supervision.<br><br>But of all his children, William believed Betsy was most in need of his watchful eye. Her yearning for an alternative to American society was only one of the traits that disturbed him. The truth was that this daughter was both a source of displeasure and an absolute mystery to William Patterson. He could not, and would never, see how similar in temperament and personality he and Betsy were; indeed, she shared with him a fierce ambition, a stubborn desire to have her own way, and in her teenage years, an impetuosity and risk-taking that reflected his own character at that same age. Father and daughter, so much alike, would spend their lives locked in a battle of wills that neither could hope to win.<br><br>Betsy found an escape from the pall cast by her father in books. She developed a habit of writing commentary in the margins as she read, and she would continue this in later years as she annotated the letters she read and saved. She was clearly precocious, memorizing French texts like La Rochefoucauld&#x2019;s Maxims and poring over a book by the French intellectual Madame de Sta�l. Her intelligence and intellectual bent did not escape the notice of more conventional friends and relatives. &#x201c;She is a most extraordinary girl,&#x201d; observed another young Maryland woman, Rosalie Stier Calvert, labeling Betsy &#x201c;in short, a modern philosophe.&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever the sources of her attachment to European culture&#x2014;the French presence in Baltimore, the romantic poems and Enlightenment manifestos she read, her father&#x2019;s strict supervision, or her deep desire to escape her mother&#x2019;s fate&#x2014;by the time she was seventeen, Betsy Patterson would have agreed with a later critic of American culture, Henry James, who would give voice to her discontent in succinct fashion: America lacked all that was desirable, &#x201c;No sovereign, no court . . . no museums, no pictures.&#x201d; At seventeen, Betsy was convinced she had been born on the wrong side of the Atlantic. The problem was how to get to the other side.<br><br>Betsy&#x2019;s criticism of American culture and her attachment to Europe&#x2019;s aristocratic society made her unusual in Baltimore&#x2019;s elite circles. Her beauty made her exceptional. At seventeen, she was petite but perfectly proportioned; her hair was thick and chestnut brown; her eyes, which some described as hazel and others as blue, were large and bright. She was slender, with the softly rounded shoulders that men of her day admired, and her clear complexion was the envy of her female peers. Men were quick to take note of her extraordinary looks, and long into middle and even old age, she was showered with flowery compliments and ardent poetry from admirers. A young cousin declared in 1802 that even when she was absent, her beauty outshone that of other young women: &#x201c;I most solemnly declare that all . . . were incapable of arresting my attention away for a moment&#x2014;no madam each thought, each idea, were immoveably [sic] fixed upon the pleasing tho&#x2019; dangerous, perhaps delusive contemplation of an absent object . . . at the bare recital of that name ten thousand inexpressible sensations crowd impetuously upon me.&#x201d;<br><br>Betsy was flattered but apparently unmoved by the admiration of local suitors. If she assumed, as surely all girls of her class and era did, that marriage and motherhood were an inevitable part of female life, she nevertheless nurtured a hope that someone would rescue her from the dull and constricting married life that lay ahead. And in 1803 that hope seemed to become a reality when a handsome stranger appeared in staid Baltimore City. His name was J�r�me Bonaparte, and he was the youngest brother of the first consul of France, Napoleon.<br><br>J�r�me was handsome, charming&#x2014;and terminally spoiled. He was the youngest son of Letizia Ramolino and Carlo Buonaparte, who, like Dorcas and William Patterson, had thirteen children, although only eight survived. The family&#x2019;s rise was already legendary in 1803&#x2014;from the isolation and unrest of Ajaccio, Corsica, to the slums of Marseilles and on to the palaces of France, where Napoleon now directed that country&#x2019;s political and military future.</p><h2>Patrick Henry: Voice of the Revolution</h2><p>Looks at the life of Patrick Henry, the Virginia lawmaker and politician known for his stirring speeches and eloquent writing.</p><p>Jon Kukla received his B.A. from Carthage College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Toronto.

One of the places I found privacy was in books. I could be anywhere at all, but if I was reading it book I was by in myself. Sometimes it was hard for me to get books. In the 1950s, when I was a child, the South was rigidly segregated. The Demopolis Public library was for whites; I black child could not go there. My mother arranged for a white friend to get books from the library for me. Many years later, I returned to Demopolis and gave some of the books I had written to the library I could never enter as a child. Some Years after that, I was invited to give an important speech it that same library.</p><p>"I attended high school in Boston, Massachuetts, and college in a variety of places, the first of which was Alabama State University in Montgomery. It Was the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began after a black woman named osa Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man. Inspired by her action and led by a young minister Martin Luther King, Jr., black people boycotted the buses for more than a year until the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. I helped hand out leaflets urging black people to stay off the buses and Was expelled front the college for doing so. Georgetown University In Washington, D.C., then offered me a scholarship, and I enrolled there.</p><p>"After graduating from college, I moved to New York, where I sold newspaper advertising space and worked as a stock trader on Wall Street before I decided to become a teacher. I taught music and special education classes in Harlem; My first book, <em>Diary Of a Schoolteacher,</em> was a result of my experiences.</p><p>"It was the 1960s, and college and high school Students were demonstrating against the war in Vietnam and for the civil rights of black people. My students were aware of those events and wanted to know more about them. But there were no books written on their level. So I started writing books for young people about the various movements--antiwar, civil rights, black power. After that I began writing biographies of black people, because young people black and white--like to read about how successful people grew up and overcame the barriers of poverty and racial discrinination.</p><p>"Since the early 1970s, I have taught on the collage level, and I have continued to write books. I have published more than 125 on many subjects for children, young adults, and adults. In 1994, the <em>Washington Post</em> Children's Book Guild honored me for my body of work in nonfiction for children.</p><p>"I have learned a lot from writing books. I have also met many important people, including Mrs. Rosa Parks herself, because I helped her write her autobiographies for young adults, <em>Rosa Park: My Story</em>; and for children, <em>I Am Rosa Parks</em>. When I think about that, I am amazed that the woman who was so important to my experiences as a young college student--not to mention the whole civil rights movement--now my friend.</p><p>"Books were once--and still are--a way to find my own private world. But they have also introduced me to a world far larger than I would otherwise have experienced. I love books, and I feel very fortunate to have been able to share this love With so many People."</p>Grade 3 UpAThis informative picture book is a handsomely illustrated overview of Africa's ancient empires. From thousands of years ago when the Sahara was green and fertile, to the peak of the African slave trade in the late 1700's, many cultures flourished. Readers learn that Egypt was once ruled by the Kushites, whose kings were shown in temple and tomb depictions as black pharaohs. European explorers and exploiters ignored the continent's past in their preoccupation with treasure. The slaves who survived the brutal journey of the Middle Passage brought with them their rich oral history and traditions, eventually blending elements of their cultures with those of the New World in North, Central, and South America. There is just enough information in the text to leave children curious to learn more about these ancient empires, and the extensive bibliography points to more detailed sources. Cooper's understated paintings in muted colors effectively convey a feeling of strength and power. His oil wash on boards technique gives a textured antique appearance to the beautiful double-page spreads. A stunning introduction to African history.AEunice Weech, M. L.

K. Kellogg Endowed Chair in Sustainable Food Systems with the Southwest Center at the University of Arizona. He lives in Flagstaff, Arizona.A journey from Florence to Assisi in the steps of St. Francis proves as much a spiritual quest as an eclectic scientific inquiry for enthnobotanist Nabhan (Enduring Seeds, 1989). While recovering from a painful divorce, Nabhan, who's part Lebanese, decided to walk the two hundred miles between Florence and Assisi ``in part to ponder my Mediterranean roots, and in part to learn of the land of my saint, San Francisco.'' Before he set off, he made a brief visit to Genoa, home of Christopher Columbus, where, in a local market, he found prickly pears, native to the Americas but now at home in the Old World: This sort of cross- fertilization of plants and seeds--as well as of cultures--is one of the author's subtexts here. Another is the need for ``rough country land where we can be truant and not have to pay to get in or be inspected on the way out.'' Nabhan discovered that little of such wilderness is left in Italy: The wolves have gone; the forests where chestnuts or truffles grow are planned; and even the ancient oaks at St. Francis's shrine, protected as artifacts rather than as living organisms, are dying from benign attention. Civilization is always close by, providing a mix of old and new: rock music and the waltz at an Umbrian corn festival (leading Nabhan to a brief history of corn in Italy, where it once caused pellagra among the peasants); farmers cultivating ancient native crops alongside New World imports like tomatoes and sunflowers; the tasting of the season's first truffles, dug up by dogs rather than by the traditional pigs. Throughout, Nabhan relates his experiences with a beguiling candor that's spoiled by only a few obvious thoughts and insights about human relationships. An enjoyable mix of information and opinion from a writer whose delight in nature is always wise and thoughtful, never sentimental or smug. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

D. (Hilda Doolittle. 1886-1961) in 1958, the year Ezra Pound was released from St. Elizabeth's in Washington, D.C., and returned to Italy. H. D., hospitalized in Switzerland from a fall, was urged to put down on paper, once and for all, her memories of Pound, which reached back to 1905, when she was a freshman at Bryn Mawr and he a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</strong></p> They had been engaged for a period, and what began as a brief romance developed into a lifetime's friendship and collaboration in poetry. Throughout the reminiscence runs H. D's conviction that her life and Pound's had been irrevocably entwined since those early days when they had walked together in the Pennsylvania woods and he wrote for her verse after William Morris, Rossetti, Swinburne, and Chaucer. Twenty-five of these poems, handbound in vellum by Pound and called "Hilda's Book," are published here for the first time as an epilogue to this important and moving document.</p><p>H.D. (1886-1961) (the pen name of Hilda Doolittle) was born in the Moravian community of Bethlehem, PA in 1886. A major twentieth century poet with &#x201c;an ear more subtle than Pound&#x2019;s, Moore&#x2019;s, or Yeats&#x2019;s&#x201d; as Marie Ponsot writes, she was the author of several volumes of poetry, fiction, essays, and memoirs.

Are we <em>ready</em> to face it? Editors Charles W. Colson and Nigel M. de S. Cameron, along with a panel of expert contributors, make the case in this book that the greatest watershed debates of the twenty-first century concerning ethics and public policy will surround the issue of biotechnology. In twelve essays they address several of the legal and ethical challenges before us: embryo research, stem cell research, cloning, genetic engineering, gene therapy, pharmacogenomics, cybernetics, nanotechnology and, of course, abortion.

With the latest advances in biotechnology, not only are we taking upon ourselves the god-like prerogative of ending human life as we choose (as we have done with abortion and euthanasia), but we are attempting to appropriate the god-like prerogative of making human life as we choose.

In truth, these elegant grasses, encompassing both woody and herbaceous forms, can achieve dramatic yet restrained effects in a range of climates. Their uses include both the ornamental, offering striking foliage and culms, and the practical, such as for screening or erosion control, not to mention the culinary treat of bamboo shoots and the structural qualities of the culm wood. Tropical and subtropical bamboos present many possibilities for landscapes in warmer climates, while the hardier species can be grown as far north as Minnesota in the United States and in the cooler climes of England and continental Europe. Bamboo culture has a long and distinguished legacy in East Asia, but much remains to be explored by Western gardeners and landscapers. Bamboo expert Ted Jordan Meredith provides a thorough and multifaceted treatment of these ancient grasses, covering origins and history, structure and form, cultivation and propagation, landscaping, and taxonomy and identification. He offers insight into selecting the right plant for the right situation, and presents useful advice on the best methods for containing or eradicating potentially invasive forms. The bulk of the book is an encyclopedia of bamboo genera, species, and cultivars. More than 300 bamboos from 40 different genera are described in detail, including information on size, lighting and temperature requirements, native range, physical characteristics, and landscape and other uses. Meredith&#39;s excellent color photos and clear line drawings effectively illustrate both the details and broader effects of these exquisite plants.</p><p>A thorough treatment of these ancient grasses, including advice on selecting the right plant for the right situation, from tropical and subtropical species for warm climates to hardy species that can be grown as far north as Minnesota.

Such dogmas are not only limiting, but&nbsp;dangerous for the future of humanity.<br>&nbsp;<br>According to these principles, all of reality is material or physical; the world is a machine, made up of inanimate matter; nature is purposeless; consciousness is nothing but the physical activity of the brain; free will is an illusion; God exists only as an idea in human minds, imprisoned within our skulls. <br>&nbsp;<br>But should science be a belief-system, or a method of enquiry? Sheldrake shows that the materialist ideology is moribund; under its sway, increasingly expensive research is reaping diminishing returns while societies around the world are paying the price. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the skeptical spirit of true science, Sheldrake turns the ten fundamental dogmas of materialism into exciting questions, and shows how all of them open up startling new possibilities for discovery.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Science Set Free</i>&nbsp;will radically change your view of what is real and what is possible.</p><p><p>DR.

It seems more natural to assume that we are living organisms, and so are animals and plants. Organisms are self-organizing; they form and maintain themselves, and have their own ends or goals. Machines, by contrast, are designed by an external mind; their parts are put together by external machine-makers and they have no purposes or ends of their own.<br><br>The starting point for modern science was the rejection of the older, organic view of the universe. The machine metaphor became central to scientific thinking, with very far-reaching consequences. In one way it was immensely liberating. New ways of thinking became possible that encouraged the invention of machines and the evolution of technology. In this chapter, I trace the history of this idea, and show what happens when we question it.<br><br>Before the seventeenth century, almost everyone took for granted that the universe was like an organism, and so was the earth. In classical, medieval and Renaissance Europe, nature was alive. Leonardo da Vinci (1452&#x2013;1519), for example, made this idea explicit: &#x201c;We can say that the earth has a vegetative soul, and that its flesh is the land, its bones are the structure of the rocks&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;its breathing and its pulse are the ebb and flow of the sea.&#x201d; William Gilbert (1540&#x2013;1603), a pioneer of the science of magnetism, was explicit in his organic philosophy of nature: &#x201c;We consider that the whole universe is animated, and that all the globes, all the stars, and also the noble earth have been governed since the beginning by their own appointed souls and have the motives of self-conservation.&#x201d; <br><br>Even Nicholas Copernicus, whose revolutionary theory of the movement of the heavens, published in 1543, placed the sun at the center rather than the earth was no mechanist. His reasons for making this change were mystical as well as scientific. He thought a central position dignified the sun:<br><br>Not unfittingly do some call it the light of the world, others the soul, still others the governor. Tremigistus calls it the visible God: Sophocles&#x2019; Electra, the All-seer. And in fact does the sun, seated on his royal throne, guide his family of planets as they circle around him<br><br>Copernicus&#x2019;s revolution in cosmology was a powerful stimulus for the subsequent development of physics. But the shift to the mechanical theory of nature that began after 1600 was much more radical.<br><br>For centuries, there had already been mechanical models of some aspects of nature. For example, in Wells Cathedral, in the west of England, there is a still-functioning astronomical clock installed more than six hundred years ago. The clock&#x2019;s face shows the sun and moon revolving around the earth, against a background of stars. The movement of the sun indicates the time of day, and the inner circle of the clock depicts the moon, rotating once a month. To the delight of visitors, every quarter of an hour, models of jousting knights rush round chasing each other, while a model of a man bangs bells with his heels.<br><br>Astronomical clocks were first made in China and in the Arab world, and powered by water. Their construction began in Europe around 1300, but with a new kind of mechanism, operated by weights and escapements. All these early clocks took for granted that the earth was at the center of the universe. They were useful models for telling the time and for predicting the phases of the moon; but no one thought that the universe was really like a clockwork mechanism.<br><br>A change from the metaphor of the organism to the metaphor of the machine produced science as we know it: mechanical models of the universe were taken to represent the way the world actually worked. The movements of stars and planets were governed by impersonal mechanical principles, not by souls or spirits with their own lives and purposes.<br><br>In 1605, Johannes Kepler summarized his program as follows: &#x201c;My aim is to show that the celestial machine is to be likened not to a divine organism but rather to clockwork&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;Moreover I show how this physical conception is to be presented through calculation and geometry.&#x201d;4 Galileo Galilei (1564&#x2013;1642) agreed that &#x201c;inexorable, immutable&#x201d; mathematical laws ruled everything.<br><br>The clock analogy was particularly persuasive because clocks work in a self-contained way. They are not pushing or pulling other objects. Likewise the universe performs its work by the regularity of its motions, and is the ultimate time-telling system. Mechanical clocks had a further metaphorical advantage: they were a good example of knowledge through construction, or knowing by doing. Someone who could construct a machine could reconstruct it. Mechanical knowledge was power.<br><br>The prestige of mechanistic science did not come primarily from its philosophical underpinnings but from its practical successes, especially in physics. Mathematical modelling typically involves extreme abstraction and simplification, which is easiest to realize with man-made machines or objects. Mathematical mechanics is impressively useful in dealing with relatively simple problems, such as the trajectories of cannonballs or rockets.<br><br>One paradigmatic example is billiard-ball physics, which gives a clear account of impacts and collisions of idealized billiard balls in a frictionless environment. Not only is the mathematics simplified, but billiard balls themselves are a very simplified system. The balls are made as round as possible and the table as flat as possible, and there are uniform rubber cushions at the sides of the table, unlike any natural environment. Think of a rock falling down a mountainside for comparison. Moreover, in the real world, billiard balls collide and bounce off each other in games, but the rules of the game and the skills and motives of the players are outside the scope of physics. The mathematical analysis of the balls&#x2019; behavior is an extreme abstraction.<br><br>From living organisms to biological machines<br><br>The vision of mechanical nature developed amid devastating religious wars in seventeenth-century Europe. Mathematical physics was attractive partly because it seemed to provide a way of transcending sectarian conflicts to reveal eternal truths. In their own eyes the pioneers of mechanistic science were finding a new way of understanding the relationship of nature to God, with humans adopting a God-like mathematical omniscience, rising above the limitations of human minds and bodies. As Galileo put it:<br><br>When God produces the world, he produces a thoroughly mathematical structure that obeys the laws of number, geometrical figure and quantitative function. Nature is an embodied mathematical system.<br><br>But there was a major problem. Most of our experience is not mathematical. We taste food, feel angry, enjoy the beauty of flowers, laugh at jokes. In order to assert the primacy of mathematics, Galileo and his successors had to distinguish between what they called &#x201c;primary qualities,&#x201d; which could be described mathematically, such as motion, size and weight, and &#x201c;secondary qualities,&#x201d; like color and smell, which were subjective. They took the real world to be objective, quantitative and mathematical. Personal experience in the lived world was subjective, the realm of opinion and illusion, outside the realm of science.<br><br>Ren� Descartes (1596&#x2013;1650) was the principal proponent of the mechanical or mechanistic philosophy of nature. It first came to him in a vision on November 10, 1619, when he was &#x201c;filled with enthusiasm and discovered the foundations of a marvellous science.&#x201d; He saw the entire universe as a mathematical system, and later envisaged vast vortices of swirling subtle matter, the ether, carrying around the planets in their orbits.<br><br>Descartes took the mechanical metaphor much further than Kepler or Galileo by extending it into the realm of life. He was fascinated by the sophisticated machinery of his age, such as clocks, looms and pumps. As a youth he designed mechanical models to simulate animal activity, such as a pheasant pursued by a spaniel. Just as Kepler projected the image of man-made machinery onto the cosmos, Descartes projected it onto animals. They, too, were like clockwork.8 Activities like the beating of a dog&#x2019;s heart, its digestion and breathing were programmed mechanisms. The same principles applied to human bodies.<br><br>Descartes cut up living dogs in order to study their hearts, and reported his observations as if his readers might want to replicate them: &#x201c;If you slice off the pointed end of the heart of a live dog, and insert a finger into one of the cavities, you will feel unmistakably that every time the heart gets shorter it presses the finger, and every time it gets longer it stops pressing it.&#x201d;<br><br>He backed up his arguments with a thought experiment: first he imagined man-made automata that imitated the movements of animals, and then argued that if they were made well enough they would be indistinguishable from real animals:<br><br>If any such machines had the organs and outward shapes of a monkey or of some other animal that lacks reason, we should have no way of knowing that they did not possess entirely the same nature as those animals.<br><br>With arguments like these, Descartes laid the foundations of mechanistic biology and medicine that are still orthodox today. However, the machine theory of life was less readily accepted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries than the machine theory of the universe. Especially in England, the idea of animal-machines was considered eccentric. Descartes&#x2019; doctrine seemed to justify cruelty to animals, including vivisection, and it was said that the test of his followers was whether they...</p><h2>Semiosis: A Novel (Semiosis Duology, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Human survival hinges on an bizarre alliance i</b><b>n <i>Semiosis</i>, </b><b>a </b><b>character driven science fiction novel of first contact by </b><b>debut author Sue Burke</b><b>.</b></p><p><b>2019 Campbell Memorial Award Finalist</b><br><b>2019 Locus Finalist for Best Science Fiction Novel</b><br><b><i>Locus</i> 2018 Recommended Reading List</b></p><p><b>New York Public Library&#x2015;Best of 2018</b><br><b><i>Forbes</i>&#x2015;Best Science Fiction Books of 2019-2019</b><br><b></b><b><i>The Verge</i>&#x2015;Best of 2018</b><b></b><br><b><i>Thrillist</i>&#x2015;Best Books of 2018</b><br><b></b><b><i>Vulture</i>&#x2015;10 Best Sci-Fi and Fantasy Books of 2018</b><br><b><i>Chicago Review of Books</i>&#x2015;The 10 Best Science Fiction Books of 2018</b><br><b></b><b>Texas Library Association&#x2015;Lariat List Top Books for 2019</b><br><b></b></p><p>Colonists from Earth wanted the perfect home, but they&#x2019;ll have to survive on the one they found.

Offering extensive original research, it weaves together the drama and tragedy of that terrible year, including new perspectives and material on some of the most debated episodes to have emerged from the Second World War. </p><br><br></p><p><br><br><p>James Holland was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and studied history at Durham University.&nbsp; A member of the British Commission for Military History and the Guild of Battlefield Guides, he also regularly contributes reviews and articles in national newspapers and magazines.&nbsp; He is the author of three previous historical works &#x2013; <i>Fortress </i><i>Malta</i><i>: An </i><i>Island</i><i> Under Siege, 1940-1943; Together We Stand: North Africa 1942-1943 &#x2013; Turning the Tide in the West; </i>and <i>Heroes: The Greatest Generation and the Second World War.&nbsp; </i>His many interviews with veterans of the Second World War are available at the Imperial War Museum.&nbsp; James Holland is married with two children and lives in Wiltshire.</p><br><br>&nbsp; PART IThe Road to RomeONEThe Eve of Battle May 1944 <p>There were many nationalities and differing races in the two Allied armies waiting to go into battle. The British and Americans formed the largest contingents, but there were also French, Moroccans, Algerians, Canadians, New Zealanders (whites and Maori), Poles, Nepalese, Indians (all faiths), South Africans (white, Asian, black, Zulus), and in the air forces, Australians, Rhodesians and others beside. Whatever their differing creeds and wide-ranging backgrounds, they all were relieved to see that on this day, the eve of battle, the weather was being kind. Thursday, 11 May 1944, was a glorious day: warm, with blue skies, and, by the afternoon, not a rain cloud in sight, just as it had been for most of the month. By evening, the temperature had dropped somewhat, but it was still warm, with just the faintest trace of a breeze &#x2013; even near the summit of Monte Cassino, some 1,700 feet above the valley below. In their foxholes, the men of the 45,600-strong II Polish Corps waited, repeatedly checking their weapons; eating a final meal; exchanging anxious glances. The minutes ticked by inexorably slowly. It was quiet up there, too; quieter than it had been for many days. Not a single gun fired. The mountain, it seemed, had been stilled.</p><p>It was now three weeks since the Poles had taken over the Monte Cassino sector and since then, almost every minute, both day and night, had been spent preparing for and thinking about the battle ahead. By day, the men had trained; they had held exercises in attacking strongly fortified positions, practising rock climbing and assaulting concrete bunkers. New flamethrowers were also introduced, while each squadron and platoona was given clear and detailed instructions as to what they were supposed to do when the battle began.</p><p>By night, the Poles had been even busier. Vast amounts of ammunition and supplies had to be taken up the mountainside, a task that was impossible during daylight when the enemy would easily be able to spot them &#x2013; secrecy was paramount; so, too, was saving lives for the battle ahead. It was also a task that could only be achieved by the use of pack mules and by the fortitude of the men, for there were just two paths open to them &#x2013; both old mountain tracks, which for more than six miles could be watched by the enemy. A carefully adhered-to system had been quickly established. Supplies were brought from the rear areas by truck. Under carefully laid smoke screens, they were loaded onto smaller, lighter vehicles, then, as the mountain began to rise, they were transferred onto mules and finally carried by hand and on backs by the men themselves, slogging their way up the two mountain tracks that led to the forward positions. All this was done in the dark, without any lights, and as quietly as possible. Even so, the men were often fired upon. The German gunners around Monte Cassino would lay periodic barrages along various stretches of these mountain paths and despite their best efforts, casualties mounted &#x2013; casualties II Polish Corps could ill-afford.</p><p>Now the waiting was almost over, and as the sun slipped behind the mountains on the far side of the Liri Valley, and darkness descended, the Poles knew that at long last the moment for which they had endured so much in the past four-and-a-half years was almost upon them.</p><p>In what had once been a lovely mountain meadow, the men of the 2nd Squadron, 12th Lancers, were now dug in. Part of the Polish Corps&#x2019; 3rd Carpathian Division, they were some 600 yards from the crumbled ruins of the monastery, and the ground ahead of them was pockmarked and churned by shell holes, and strewn with twisted bits of metal and remnants of the dead. Not that twenty-seven-year-old Wladek Rubnikowicz had had much chance to examine the area that was to be his part of the battlefield. In an effort to keep their presence a secret, Wladek and his comrades had been forbidden to send out patrols to reconnoitre the area. In fact, since arriving in their positions on the night of 3 May, Wladek had done little but bring up more supplies by night and brace himself for the attack by day.</p><p>The Lancers were cavalry, trained to use armoured cars and to operate as a fast-moving reconnaissance unit, but for the battle they had become infantrymen, foot-sloggers like almost every other soldier that had fought across this damnable piece of land for the past four months. The armoured cars now waited for them miles behind the line with the rear echelons. Only once the battle was won, and the men were out of the mountains and into the valleys below, would they get their vehicles back.</p><p>For the vast majority of Polish troops now lying in wait on the mountain, their journey there had been long and tortuous &#x2013; an epic trek that had seen them travel thousands of miles, crossing continents and enduring terrible losses and hardship &#x2013; and Wladek was no exception. It was a miracle that he was alive at all.</p><p>The blitzkrieg that followed the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 had lasted just twenty-eight days and on 29 September, the country was carved in two by the month-old allies, Germany and the Soviet Union. What had been a beacon of democracy was now subjugated under fascism in one half and Stalinist communism in the other. Its cities and towns lay in ruins, while its stunned people wondered how this apocalypse could have happened in such a short space of time.</p><p>Wladek, then a cadet with the Polish Army, had been wounded in the shoulder in the final days before the surrender. Left behind in a disused schoolhouse, he was helped by some local girls who tended him and brought him food and water and, once fit enough to walk, he began the long journey back home to Glebokie, a small town in what had been north-east Poland, but which had now been consumed by the Soviet Union.</p><p>His older brother had been killed in the fighting, leaving a wife and two small children, while his home town had been devastated by the war. &#x2018;I could see that every thing that made life worthwhile had come to standstill,&#x2019; Wladek recalled. Nor could he stay at home. Russian troops were everywhere, arresting Poles in their droves. He eventually managed to get to Warsaw after travelling most of the way by clutching to the buffers of a train in temperatures well below freezing, and despite being arrested at the German &#x2013; Russian border. Temporarily locked in a barn, he quickly escaped and made his way through the snow into the German-occupied half of Poland.</p><p>For a while Wladek worked for the Polish resistance movement, but on a mission back into Russian-occupied Poland, he was arrested at the border once again. This time he did not escape.</p><p>For thirteen long months, Wladek was held at Bialystok prison. He was one of fifty-six prisoners crammed into an eight-man cell. Occasionally he would be interrogated and beaten. Eventually he was sentenced to three years in a Siberian labour camp. In June 1941, he and 500 others were loaded onto a goods train, fifty to a wagon, and sent to a labour camp in the Arctic Circle.</p><p>Ventilation for the wagon came from a small, barred hole and an opening in the floor used as a toilet. There was not enough air and they all struggled to breathe properly. Each prisoner received 400 grammes of bread and one herring at the start of the journey, but the salty herring made them thirstier. They were eventually given a small cup of water each, which, they were told, had to last until the following day. Dysentery soon gripped many men, and most had fever. A number died, their bodies remaining where they lay amongst the living. &#x2018;Can you imagine?&#x2019; says Wladek. &#x2018;We didn&#x2019;t realise then that of course the Soviets hoped these conditions would kill off many of us on the way.&#x2019;</p><p>The journey lasted two weeks. The further they travelled the more bleak and desolate the surrounding country became. Eventually they halted at a railhead on the Pechora River. Staggering off their wagon, they were herded towards a transit camp before continuing their journey by paddle steamer. This took them a further 700 miles north. They disembarked a week later at Niryan-Mar Gulag, in one of the most northern parts of Russia.</p><p>Conditions had been bad at Bialystok, but Niryan-Mar reached new depths of deprivation. The men were housed in large marquee-like summer tents, each sheltering around 180 men, and although they each had a rough wooden bunk to sleep on, there were neither mattresses nor blankets and the prisoners slept fully clothed at all times. They kept their clothes stuffed with cotton wool and although they just about managed to keep warm, they were soon plagued by lice.</p><p>Every day the prisoners were put to work at the nearby port on the mouth of the Pechora for twelve-hour days of physically demanding labour, sustained only by meagre rations of water and hard bread. As Wladek says: &#x2018;We worked as slaves.&#x2019;</p><p>The camp was surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers, but there was nowhere a prisoner could go even if he did escape: they were miles from anywhere and the surrounding forests and marshes were home to wolves. Even so, Wladek did make one bid for freedom. A Swedish vessel came into port and thinking the crew seemed friendly and sympathetic, he managed to slip away and hide in the hold. He misjudged them, however. Soon discovered, he was handed back to the Soviets. &#x2018;The punishment I received I shall never forget,&#x2019; he says; Wladek was beaten to within an inch of his life.</p><p>Inevitably, many prisoners succumbed to disease. Illness, however, was no excuse not to work. Despite high fevers and crippling dysentery, prisoners had to keep going, as &#x2018;the alternative to working was death&#x2019;. Wladek&#x2019;s malnutrition caused him to start to go blind. His affliction was worse in the evening and to ensure that he did not step out of line and that he made it safely back to camp each night, he depended on others to guide him.</p><p>This hell did eventually come to an end, however. Months after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he and his fellow prisoners were released and, armed with a free rail pass and some meagre rations, were told to head south. As they did so, Stalin had already begun to renege on his promises and large numbers, Wladek included, were forcibly detained on collective farms. He and several others managed to escape by stealing and pilfering, and, weeks later, they finally reached the Polish camp at Guzar in Uzbekistan, one of the most southerly points in the Soviet Union.</p><p>Even before Wladek had left the gulag and set out on the journey that would take him eventually from the Arctic Circle to the edge of Persia, he had been in a weakened physical state &#x2013; and just a fraction of his normal body weight. Several thousand miles later, having travelled by rail, boat, and on sore and bloody feet, he was seriously ill. Struggling with a high fever, he staggered to the Polish camp&#x2019;s registration office and was then sent to the first aid station, where he was told he had contracted typhoid.</p><p>Meanwhile, General Wladyslaw Anders in the southern Soviet Union, and General Sikorski, the Commander-in-Chief of the Free Polish Forces, in London, had been having a difficult time with the Soviet leaders. It had been the Poles&#x2019; hope and intention that the reconstituted Polish Army should fight as a whole against Germany on the Eastern Front, which would send out a strong signal to the world about Polish solidarity and their fighting spirit. Stalin, however, who had designs on Poland if and when Germany was beaten, had no intention of allowing this to happen, and so had been making life as difficult as possible, giving the Poles mustering areas and camps in inhospitable parts of the Soviet Union where disease &#x2013; such as typhoid &#x2013; was rife, and waylaying potential Polish troops by forcing them to work on collective farms.</p><p>Eventually, however, Stalin decided he wanted to free himself of any obligations to arm and provide for the Polish Army, no matter how useful they might one day be. Churchill had let it be known that he wanted Polish forces fighting alongside the Allies in the Middle East, and so under pressure from both Britain and America, Sikorski agreed that Anders&#x2019; Polish Army should be evacuated to Persia, from where they would train under British guidance.</p><p>Wladek Rubnikowicz was still making his miraculous recovery from typhoid when the first evacuation to Persia was made, but he joined the next one a few months later, only to contract malaria. After a couple of weeks the fever subsided leaving him with recurrences of the disease that would plague him for years to come. Things were looking up, however. He made his way to Iraq, where he joined General Anders&#x2019; camp at Quisil Ribat Oasis and where training began in earnest. It was whilst there that Wladek also heard good news about his parents. They too had escaped from the Soviet Union and were at a camp in Iran. He even managed to get leave to see them.</p><p>Now with the 12th Polish Lancers of the newly formed II Polish Corps, Wladek moved with his regiment to Kirkuk. With plentiful rations and a moderately balanced diet, he and the rest of his Polish comrades gradually began to build up their strength. &#x2018;We all felt anxious to get to the front,&#x2019; he says, &#x2018;and begin fighting for the liberation of Poland. That may sound strange, but it&#x2019;s true.&#x2019;</p><p>After further training in Palestine, the 12th Lancers, part of the 3rd Carpathian Division, reached Italy in December 1943. Several months were spent carrying out final training and acclimatising, until, in the middle of April, they were moved up to the Cassino front.</p><p>In fact, General Sir Oliver Leese, commander of the British Eighth Army, under which II Polish Corps served, had visited General Anders on 24 March and proposed that his troops be given the task of taking the Monte Cassino heights and then the hill-top village of Piedimonte, several miles to the west in what would become the fourth battle of Cassino. &#x2018;It was,&#x2019; noted Anders, &#x2018;a great moment for me.&#x2019;2</p><p>The Polish commander had suffered as well in the previous years of war. Captured by the Russians in September 1939, Anders had been imprisoned in Lubianka after refusing to join the Red Army. Released after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was given permission to trace and recruit Polish POWs held in the gulags. It was largely thanks to his tireless efforts that he managed to muster some 160,000 men in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan who were then trained to continue the fight for Poland. Now, at Cassino, he had a small corps of two divisions and an armoured brigade made up of 45,626 fighting men. It was an incredible achievement by the dashing and charismatic fifty-two-year-old.</p><p>For a few moments only, Anders had considered Leese&#x2019;s suggestion. He was well aware that Monte Cassino had not been taken in two months of bitter fighting; that it had hitherto eluded the efforts of battle-hardened and highly experienced troops. The task that Leese was putting forward was an awesome proposition for his men in what would be their first battle since the fall of Poland. &#x2018;The stubbornness of the German defence at Cassino and on Monastery Hill was already a byword,&#x2019; Anders observed. &#x2018;I realised that the cost in lives must be heavy, but I realised too the importance of the capture of Monte Cassino to the Allied cause, and most of all to that of Poland.&#x2019;3 And so he accepted.</p><p>Now, on the evening of 11 May, the moment had almost arrived. Wladek and his comrades had been thoroughly briefed. The messages of Generals Alexander and Leese to their troops had been translated into Polish and the single sheets of thin paper passed around. So too had Anders&#x2019; own message. &#x2018;Soldiers!&#x2019; he wrote, &#x2018;The moment for battle has arri...</p></p><h2>Under Fire: Great Photographers and Writers In Vietnam</h2><p>An award-winning combat photographer brings together a memorable collection of photographs, complemented by text from great writers of the period, that captures the personalities, events, and campaigns of the Vietnam War, with contributions by Philip Caputo, Neil Sheehan, David Halberstam, Tim Page, Kyoichi Sawada, Robert Ellison, and others. 30,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Uller Uprising</h2><p>The four-armed reptilian natives of the planet Uller revolt against the chartered company from the Terran Federation which rules them</p><p>H.

She seemed destined for either the highest fame or the worst destruction--maybe even both. From the big time to rock bottom and back again, her life reads like a blueprint for one of the melancholy songs that made her a star in country music, and her revealing memoir, <i>Nickel Dreams: My Life,</i> leaves out little of the nitty-gritty. With the aid of author and friend Patsi Bale Cox, Tucker writes honestly about her many exploits that became tabloid fodder--a fiery public affair with Glen Campbell and a long battle with alcoholism among them--without glossing over them or apologizing. There are plenty of anecdotes and revelations about her music as well, plus a peek at the backrooms of the music business and the shady dealings that occur there. Close attention is paid to her childhood and the overbearing presence of a father/manager who wanted his daughter to be a grown woman and a little girl at the same time.Country legend Tanya Tucker tells her tumultuous life story with warmth and modesty. Tucker (born in 1958) lived fast and hard, only settling down in recent years. When she recorded her first hit, ``Delta Dawn,'' the confident 13-year-old introduced herself to her stellar backup band by saying, ``I know my part, boys. Do you know yours?'' She inherited this bravura from her father, who pushed his way through music industry doors on behalf of Tucker. He is omnipresent in the book, sometimes dominating his daughter's professional and personal life, managing her career, and at one point arranging an intervention of family and friends to convince Tucker to check into the Betty Ford clinic. Tucker defends her father throughout, giving him most of the credit for her success. Professionally, the book charts Tucker's growth from a naive young singer to the mature performer and songwriter she has become. Tucker's life has provided much grist for the tabloids over the years, and readers will likely find her version of these notorious episodes compelling. She had a rocky affair with fellow country singer Glen Campbell, with whom she often took drugs. During one argument, he knocked out her two front teeth with his elbow. When Campbell announced that his wife was pregnant and that he wouldn't leave her, Tucker ran off with Merle Haggard. Tucker has two children, both born out of wedlock, and she kept the father's identity secret--even from the father-- for some time. Tucker's hard-living and frequent excesses ensure that there are no dull moments in her story. But readers will come to like the singer well enough to wish her less interesting times.

The story has the same sense of epic vastness despite happening mostly in one isolated solar system. Here there's a world of intelligent spider creatures who traditionally hibernate through the "Deepest Darkness" of their strange variable sun's long "off" periods, when even the atmosphere freezes. Now, science offers them an alternative... Meanwhile, attracted by spider radio transmissions, two human starfleets come exploring--merchants hoping for customers and tyrants who want slaves. Their inevitable clash leaves both fleets crippled, with the power in the wrong hands, which leads to a long wait in space until the spiders develop exploitable technology. Over the years Vinge builds palpable tension through multiple storylines and characters. In the sky, hopes of rebellion against tyranny continue despite soothing lies, brutal repression, and a mental bondage that can convert people into literal tools. Down below, the engagingly sympathetic spiders have their own problems. In flashback, we see the grandiose ideals and ultimate betrayal of the merchant culture's founder, now among the human contingent and pretending to be a senile buffoon while plotting, plotting... Major revelations, ironies, and payoffs follow. A powerful story in the grandest SF tradition. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Vinge has done it again. <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i> is vivid, suspenseful, [and] realistic. Vinge's villains are chillingly believable, and so is his vision of a hopeful tomorrow." --David Brin<p> "Vernor Vinge's latest novel is a triumph, continuing the most visionary, intelligent deep-space adventure of our time. Reason to cheer, indeed--and a great, long read it is." --Gregory Benford</p></p><h2>The Wonderful Future That Never Was: Flying Cars, Mail Delivery by Parachute, and Other Predictions from the Past</h2><p>Between 1903 and 1969, scientists and other experts made hundreds of predictions in <i>Popular Mechanics</i> magazine about what the future would hold. Their forecasts ranged from ruefully funny to eerily prescient and optimistically utopian. Here are the very best of them, culled from hundreds of articles, complete with the original, visually stunning retro art. They will capture the imagination of futurists in the same way Jules Verne's writing did a century earlier. Every chapter features an introduction by astrophysics professor, science-fiction author, and former NASA advisor Gregory Benford.<br>PAST PREDICTIONS OF OUR FUTURE INCLUDE:<br>Skyscrapers so tall they'll have their own climate&nbsp; o&nbsp; Underground pneumatic tubes to replace garbage trucks&nbsp; o&nbsp; Rooftop lakes that serve as air conditioning systems&nbsp; o&nbsp; Clothes made from asbestos and aluminum&nbsp; o&nbsp; Mail sorted by robots and delivered by parachutes<br></p><p>Gregory Benford is a two-time winner of the Nebula Award, a professor of physics at the University of California and has served as an advisor to the Department of Energy, NASA and the White House Council on Space Policy. He is the author of more than 20 novels and has won the John W. Campbell Award, the Australian Ditmar Award, the 1995 Lord Foundation Award for achievement in the sciences and the 1990 United Nations Medal in Literature.*Starred Review* Benford, an astrophysicist and noted science-fiction author, teams up with the editors of Popular Mechanics to take readers on a tour through a future that (mostly) never happened. If the various predictions seen here&#x2014;all taken from the magazine&#x2019;s archives&#x2014;had come true, we&#x2019;d be living today in cities with multiple underground levels for pedestrians and traffic (predicted in 1928); or cities made of glass (1936). We&#x2019;d be living in homes with furniture you clean with a hose (1950) and wearing clothing made of aluminum (1929), or maybe asbestos (also 1929). Our cars would fly (1928, 1943), or maybe we&#x2019;d be driving Rotavions, personal vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles that can operate as an airfoil or a helicopter (1961). Despite the fact that many of the predictions discussed in the book seem laughably silly today, they&#x2019;re not played for laughs; they&#x2019;re presented as historical curiosities, examples of how predictions based on cutting-edge research and extrapolated from social trends can seem sensible when they&#x2019;re made but not so much later on. And it&#x2019;s worth noting, as the editors do, that some predictions did come true, like pocket-size computers (predicted in 1962) and mass-produced, prepackaged frozen dinners (1947). Profusely illustrated (there&#x2019;s something on nearly every page), the book is endlessly fascinating, a collage of snapshots of the present the way people saw it when it was still the distant future. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Apple and the Butterfly</h2><p>A caterpillar crawls out of an apple and retreats into its cocoon. As the seasons change, the caterpillar becomes a butterfly. Setting itself free, the butterfly feeds on a flower that grows into an apple, bringing the story full circle.

From evaluating a property to making foundation repairs to adding on a porch, it&#39;s a comprehensive guide to every aspect of making renovations and repairs--whether you already live in, or are contemplating buying, an older home.</p><p>Nash is a renovation contractor and fencebuilding enthusiast.This is a reincarnation of Nash's out-of-print classic, Old House: A Rebuilder's Manual ( LJ 1/15/80), substantially rewritten and reorganized. The focus is the major defects of old houses: the heaved foundation walls, defunct mechanical systems, rotted structural timbers, damaged roofs, and broken staircases. Nash is both an artful writer and a knowledgeable renovation specialist. He writes with poetic grace about the unique character and hidden beauty of old houses, yet he's remarkably clearheaded and resourceful when dealing with their often maddening irregularities. There isn't a better sourcebook on the larger structural challenges of renovation. Most libraries should have this as a companion volume to Michael Litchfield's Renovation: A Complete Guide ( LJ 8/90. rev. ed.).<br><i>- Bill Demo, Tompkins Cortland Community Coll., Dryden, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Garbage: A Poem</h2><p>As the citation for the 1993 National Book Award for Poetry said, &#34;Garbage is an epic of ideas: all life--not that of human beings alone, but of every species--is shown to be part of an ultimate reality. . . . For power of the thought and language, the poem takes its place alongside Whitman&#39;s &#39;Song of Myself&#39;--an American classic.&#34;</p><p>"Garbage," A.R. Ammons writes in this book-length poem, "has to be the poem of our time because / garbage is spiritual, believable enough / to get our attention, getting in the way..." Talky and playful, the couplets of the National Book Award-winning <i>Garbage</i> propel one through the trash dump of 20th-century meaning, as well as into the past and future, where "millennia jiggle in your eyes at night." This project, by turns wryly self-deprecating and densely philosophical, places Ammons in the company of such recent epic funnymen as John Ashbery, Ronald Johnson, and, very self-consciously, William Carlos Williams. Like any good epic, the poem begins in doubt, with Ammons wondering whether to write the book or simply retire and live a life of leisure on Social Security (plus a surely ample pension from his longtime Cornell University professorship). Like John Milton in the preamble to his epic, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Ammons uses the metaphor of a tree to focus his poetic ambition. "I mean," he writes, "take my yard maple--put out in the free / and open--has overgrown, its trunk / split down from a high fork ... The fat tree, unable to stop pouring it on, overfed and overgrew ... It just / goes to show you: moderation imposed is better / than no moderation at all." Indeed, the poem's 121 pages seem at times nothing more than an attempt to buoy the moment between two extremes: exuberant falsehoods at one end of the scale, cynical platitudes on the other. This "moderation" has served as Ammons' dominant aesthetic during his long poetic career, though <i>Garbage</i>'s length and epic ambitions disrupt his trademark austerity. Despite his tangential questioning of reality and time, the poem's ultimate wisdom lies in how it imagines the actively good person, one who sees that <blockquote> ...life, life is like a poem: the moment it<br> begins, it begins to end: the tension this<br> <p> establishes makes every move and movement, every<br> gap and stumble, every glide and rise significant<br> </p></blockquote> In a time when most poetry is about loss, Ammons wanders through our community junkyard and, with his good eye, points out what's valuable, and tells us, in his trustworthy tone, why. <i>--Edward Skoog</i>A. R. Ammons&#39;s (1926-2001) was a two-time winner of the National Book Award and the recipient of a National Book Critics Circle Award. His many additional honors include the Academy of American Poets&#39; Wallace Stevens Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Poetry Society of America&#39;s Robert Frost Medal, the Ruth Lilly Prize, and fellowships from the Guggenheim and MacArthur Foundations.</p><h2>She Can Coach!</h2><p><p>Sport needs more female coaches.

In a very succinct and enjoyable manner, it teaches one to perform to the very best of his ability, using the Pose running technique. In ballet, or martial arts, one requires practice of technique. The same is true of running. Unless you are one of the lucky ones, like Haile Gebrselassie, Steve Prefontaine, or Michael Johnson, who were born with the perfect technique, you have to learn it. Until Dr Romanov's discovery there was no coherent theory on the subject. Running was practiced, but not taught as a skill. The Pose Method proposes to teach running as a skill with its own theory, concepts, and exercises. <p>Like any brilliant idea, the idea behind the Pose Method is simple. Every movement is built on an infinite number of poses, or positions, through which the body goes in space and time. In running, Dr. Romanov focuses on only one pose, which he calls the Running Pose. It is a whole body position, with vertically aligned shoulders, hips and ankles that creates an S-like shape of the body. The runner then changes the pose from one leg to the other allowing gravity to draw him forward. This creates forward movement, with the least energy cost, and the least effort. The end result is faster race times, easier running and no more injuries! </p><p>Many have been asking for this book and are awaiting it eagerly. USA and British Triathlon teams have been working with Dr. Romanov with great success. Scientific research on the Pose Method effects on runners was conducted at the USA Olympic Training Center (Colorado Springs) in 1997, at Florida Atlantic University (Boca Raton, FL) in 1998-2001, at Sheffield Hallam University (Great Britain) in 2001, at Kubansky State University (Krasnodar, Russia) in 2002, and at Cape Town University (South Africa) in 2002 with Tim Noakes, author of the Lore Of Running, the runner,s bible. The results of the last research are very impressive. The load on knee joints is reduced 30%, the incidence of other injuries is drastically diminished. The method allows the athletes to run easier, faster, longer, and most significantly, injury free.</p></p><p>PREFACE to "POSE Method� of Running" <p>By Nicholas Romanov, Ph.D. <br>April 18, 2004 </p><p>The Pose Method� of Running, the result of over 25 years of studying human movement and developing a singular approach to running technique. Never before has a running book started with the notion that you must first learn how to run before you begin to train for running. </p><p>Instead of loading you down with information on exercise heart rates, pacing, tactics, rest, and nutrition &#x2013; all of which are very important components of the total running experience &#x2013; The Pose Method� of Running gets right to the heart of the matter with drills and routines designed to make you an efficient, capable runner. And once you know how to run, you&#x2019;ll find that all the rest of it comes very easily and naturally. </p><p>Think about it. If you can&#x2019;t hit a tennis ball over the net, there is no sense in playing a match. If you can&#x2019;t drive a golf ball past the end of the tee, why tee it up for 18? And if you can&#x2019;t run in a relaxed, efficient, injury-free manner, why toe the line at a local 10K or triathlon? </p><p>The Pose Method� of Running in all likelihood will be easier to use for novice runners, who have no preconceived notions of technique and training, but it may have more long-term value for veteran runners who may have become frustrated by chronic injuries or failure to improve beyond a certain plateau. The novice will appreciate the simple steps necessary to adapt to the Pose Method� and will literally be able to get off on the right foot in taking up the sport. </p><p>Will the Pose Method� of Running truly make you a faster runner who suffers fewer injuries? The answer is clearly "yes", if you master the technique and make a sensible training regime a part of your life. And you know what? You may even thank the person who gave you this book in the first place, particularly if you grow to love running even half as much as I do.</p>The reason for the development of the Pose Method� was the absence of a method for teaching running technique. Running was practiced, but not taught as a skill. <br><br>Pose Method� was the first methodology to teach running as a skill, with it's own theory, concepts, and exercises.&nbsp;<br><br>Pose Method� was developed in 1977 in Soviet Union by Nicholas Romanov.<br><br>For more information please visit posemethod.com</p><h2>Archer in Jeopardy: The Doomsters, The Zebra-Striped Hearse, &amp; The Instant Enemy (Three Novels)</h2><p>Brings together three of the acclaimed mystery writer&#39;s Lew Archer novels--The Zebra-Striped Hearse, and The Instant Enemy--three winners with the incomparable Macdonald touch</p><p></p><h2>The Poet&#39;s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rilke</h2><p><b>&#x201c;You have to live life to the limit, not according to each day but by plumbing its depth.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;RAINER MARIA RILKE<br></b><br>In this treasury of uncommon wisdom and spiritual insight,<i> </i>the best writings and personal philosophies of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest poets, Rainer Maria Rilke, are gleaned by Ulrich Baer from thousands of pages of never-before translated correspondence. <br><br>The result is a profound vision of how the human drive to create and understand can guide us in every facet of life. Arranged by theme&#x2013;from everyday existence with others to the exhilarations of love and the experience of loss, from dealing with adversity to the nature of inspiration, here are Rilke&#x2019;s thoughts on how to live life in a meaningful way:<br><br><i>Life and Living: </i>&#x201c;How good life is. How fair, how incorruptible, how impossible to deceive: not even by strength, not even by willpower, and not even by courage. How everything remains what it is and has only this choice: to come true, or to exaggerate and push too far.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Art:</i> &#x201c;The work of art is adjustment, balance, reassurance. It can be neither gloomy nor full of rosy hopes, for its essence consists of justice.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Faith:</i> &#x201c;I personally feel a greater affinity to all those religions in which the middleman is less essential or almost entirely suppressed.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Love:</i> &#x201c;To be loved means to be ablaze. To love is: to shine with inexhaustible oil. To be loved is to pass away; to love is to last.&#x201d;<br><br>Intimate, stylistically masterful, brilliantly translated, and brimming with the wonder and passion of Rilke, <i>The Poet&#x2019;s Guide to Life</i> is comparable to the best works of wisdom in all of literature and a perfect book for all occasions.</p><p><b>RAINER MARIA RILKE</b> (1875&#x2014;1926) ranks among the great poets of world literature, and was the author of<i> Duino Elegies</i> and <i>Sonnets to Orpheus</i>.<br><br><b>Ulrich Baer</b>, a scholar of modern German, French, and American poetry, is the author of <i>Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul C�lan</i> and <i>Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma.</i> He is the editor of <i>110 Stories: New York Writes After September 11</i>. Baer is associate professor of German and comparative literature at New York University and acting chair of the German department.- There is only a single, urgent task: to attach oneself someplace to nature, to that which is strong, striving and bright with unreserved readiness, and then to move forward in one&#x2019;s efforts without any calculation or guile, even when engaged in the most trivial and mundane activities. Each time we thus reach out with joy, each time we cast our view toward distances that have not yet been touched, we transform not only the present moment and the one following but also alter the past within us, weave it into the pattern of our existence, and dissolve the foreign body of pain whose exact composition we ultimately do not know. Just as we do not know how much vital energy this foreign body, once it has been thus dissolved, might impart to our bloodstream!<br><br>�<br><br>If we wish to be let in on the secrets of life, we must be mindful of two things: first, there is the great melody to which things and scents, feelings and past lives, dawns and dreams contribute in equal measure, and then there are the individual voices that complete and perfect this full chorus. And to establish the basis for a work of art, that is, for an image of life lived more deeply, lived more than life as it is lived today, and as the possibility that it remains throughout the ages, we have to adjust and set into their proper relation these two voices: the one belonging to a specific moment and the other to the group of people living in it.<br><br>�<br><br> Wishes! Desires! What does life know about them? Life urges and pushes forward and it has its mighty nature into which we stare with our waiting eyes.<br><br>�<br><br>Life takes pride in not appearing uncomplicated. If it relied on simplicity, it probably would not succeed in moving us to do all those things that we are not easily moved to do . . .<br><br>�<br><br>A conscious fate that is aware of our existence . . . yes, how often we long for such a fate that would make us stronger and affirm us. But would such a fate not instantly become a fate that beholds us from the outside, observes us like a spectator, a fate that we would no longer be alone with? The fact that we have been placed into a &#x201c;blind fate&#x201d; that we inhabit allows us to have our own perspective and is the very condition of our perspicacious innocence. It is due only to the &#x201c;blindness&#x201d; of our fate that we are so profoundly related to the world&#x2019;s wonderful density, which is to say to the totality that we cannot survey and that exceeds us.<br><br>�<br><br>Seeing is for us the most authentic possibility of acquiring something. If God had only made our hands to be like our eyes&#x2014;so ready to grasp, so willing to relinquish all things&#x2014;then we could truly acquire wealth. We do not acquire wealth by letting something remain and wilt in our hands but only by letting everything pass through their grasp as if through the festive gate of return and homecoming. Our hands ought not to be a coffin for us but a bed sheltering the twilight slumber and dreams of the things held there, out of whose depths their dearest secrets speak. Once out of our hands, however, things ought to move forward, now sturdy and strong, and we should keep nothing of them but the courageous morning melody that hovers and shimmers behind their fading steps.<br><br>For property is poverty and fear; only to have possessed something and to have let go of it means carefree ownership!<br><br>�<br><br>To look at something is such a wonderful thing of which we still know so little. When we look at something, we are turned completely toward the outside by this activity. But just when we are most turned toward the outside like that, things seem to take place within us that have longed for an unobserved moment, and while they unfold within us, whole and strangely anonymous, without us, their significance begins to take shape in the external object in the form of a strong, convincing, indeed their only possible name. And by means of this name we contentedly and respectfully recognize what is happening inside us without ourselves touching upon it. We understand it only quietly, entirely from a distance, under the sign of a thing that had just been alien and in the next instant is alienated from us again.<br><br>�<br><br>It does not happen frequently that something very great is condensed into a thing that can be held entirely in one hand, in one&#x2019;s own, impotent hand. Just as when one finds a tiny bird that is thirsty. You take it away from the edge of death, and the little heartbeats increase gradually in the warm, trembling hand like the wave at the edge of a giant ocean for which you are the shore. And you suddenly realize, while holding this little recovering animal, that life is recovering from death. And you hold it up. Generations of birds, and all of the forests over which they pass, and all of the skies into which they will rise. And is any of this easy? No: you are very strong to carry the heaviest burden in such an hour.<br><br>�<br><br>Each experience has its own velocity according to which it wants to be lived if it is to be new, profound, and fruitful. To have wisdom means to discover this velocity in each individual case.<br><br>�<br><br>Wishes are the memories coming from our future!<br><br>�<br><br>Be out of sync with your times for just one day, and you will see how much eternity you contain within you.<br><br>�<br><br>After all, life is not even close to being as logically consistent as our worries; it has many more unexpected ideas and many more facets than we do.<br><br>�<br><br>My God, how magnificent life is precisely owing to its unforeseeability and to the often so strangely certain steps of our blindness.<br><br>�<br><br>Life has been created quite truthfully in order to surprise us (where it does not terrify us altogether).<br><br>�<br><br>How numerous and manifold is everything that is yet to come, and how differently it all surfaces and how differently it all passes from the way we expect. How poor we are in imagination, fantasy, and expectation, how lightly and superficially we take ourselves in making plans, only for reality then to arrive and play its melodies on us.<br><br>�<br><br>The longer I live, the more urgent it seems to me to endure and transcribe the whole dictation of existence up to its end, for it might just be the case that only the very last sentence contains that small and possibly inconspicuous word through which everything we had struggled to learn and everything we had failed to understand will be transformed suddenly into magnificent sense. And who can be sure if in the realm of the beyond it might not somehow matter that here we had reached precisely that end that was ultimately meant for us. There is also no certainty that new challenges might not confront us on the other side while we flee from here completely exhausted&#x2014;challenges that the soul, as it finds itself shaken and without having been either summoned or prepared, would face even more than other tasks with a sense of shame.<br><br>�<br><br>It is not possible to have an adequate image of how inexhaustible the expansiveness and possibilities of life are. No fate, no rejection, no hardship is entirely without prospects; somewhere the densest shrub can yield leaves, a flower, a fruit. And somewhere in God&#x2019;s furthest providence there surely exists already an insect that will gather riches from this flower or a hunger that will be sated by this fruit. And if this fruit is bitter it will have astonished at least one eye, and will have provided it pleasure and have triggered curiosity for the shapes and colors and crops of the shrub. And if the fruit were to fall, it would fall into the abundance of that which is yet to come. Even in its final decay it contributes to this future by turning it into more abundant, more colorful, and more urgent growth.<br><br>�<br><br>I have by now grown accustomed, to the degree that this is humanly possible, to grasp everything that we may encounter according to its particular intensity without worrying much about how long it will last. Ultimately, this may be the best and most direct way of expecting the utmost of everything&#x2014;even its duration. If we allow an encounter with a given thing to be shaped by this expectation that it may last, every such experience will be spoiled and falsified, and ultimately it will be prevented from unfolding its most proper and authentic potential and fertility. All the things that cannot be gained through our pleading can be given to us only as something unexpected, something extra: this is why I am yet again confirmed in my belief that often nothing seems to matter in life but the longest patience.<br><br>�<br><br>Is not everything that happens to us, whether or not we desire or solicit it, always glorious and full of the purest, clearest justice?<br><br>�<br><br>What else does it mean to live but precisely this daring under- taking of filling a mold that one day will be broken off one&#x2019;s new shoulders, so that, now free in this new metamorphosis, one may become acquainted with all the other beings that have been magically transported into the same realm?<br><br>�<br><br>We lead our lives so poorly because we arrive in the present always unprepared, incapable, and too distracted for everything.<br><br>�<br><br>It is possible to feel so very much abandoned at times. And so much depends on the tiny indulgence of things, whether we can cope at all when they suddenly don&#x2019;t respond to us and don&#x2019;t move us along. Then we stand there inside the paltriness of our body, all alone&#x2014;it is just like when we were children, when &#x201c;they&#x201d; were angry with us and pretended not to see us. Then the things were equally disloyal and there occurred a brief moment of nonbeing that forced its way up to our heart and left room for nothing else. Suffering. For what is more being than precisely this heart, where the world alternates between becoming &#x201c;object&#x201d; and &#x201c;self,&#x201d; inside and opposite, longing and fusion&#x2014;and the beats of which coincide occasionally perhaps with, God knows, what infinite other measures in outer space . . . (perhaps by chance).<br><br>�<br><br>Finally&#x2014;we know this&#x2014;life&#x2019;s little wisdom is to wait (but to wait in the proper, pure state of mind), and the great grace that is bestowed on us in return is to survive . . .<br><br>�<br><br>How tremendous both life and death are as long as one does not incessantly consider both of them to be part of one greater whole while making hardly any distinctions between them. But this is precisely a task for angels and not our task, or rather ours only as an exception that might occur during moments that have been brought into existence slowly and painfully.<br><br>�<br><br>You have to live life to the limit, not according to each day but according to its depth. One does not have to do what comes next if one feels a greater affinity with that which happens later, at a remove, even in a remote distance. One may dream while others are saviors if these dreams are more real to oneself than reality and more necessary than bread. In a word: one ought to turn the most extreme possibility inside oneself into the measure for one&#x2019;s life, for our life is vast and can accommodate as much future as we are able to carry.<br><br>�<br><br>Life has long since preempted every later possible impoverishment through its astoundingly immeasurable riches. So what is there for us to be afraid of? Only that this should be forgotten! But all around us, within us, how many ways of helping us remember!<br><br>�<br><br>The following realization rivals in its significance a religion: that once the background melody has been discovered one is no longer baffled in one&#x2019;s speech and obscure in one&#x2019;s decisions. There is a carefree security in the simple conviction that one is part of a melody, which means that one legitimately occupies a specific space and has a specific duty toward a vast work where the least counts as much as the greatest. Not to be extraneous is the first condition for an individual to consciously and quietly come into his own.<br><br>�<br><br>I want to thank you briefly for your letter; I can understand all of it quite well and can even follow you into your sadness, into this sadness that I know so deeply and which may of course be explained . . . And yet this sadness is nothing but a sensitive spot within us, always the same spot, one of those that can no longer be located once they begin to ache so that we fail to recognize and treat it when we are numb with pain. I know all of this. There is a kind of joy that is quite similar&#x2014;and somehow we might have to get beyond both of them. I just recently thought that when I spent a few days climbing the steep mountains of Anacapri and was so filled with joy up there, so strenuously joyful in my soul. We let go of one or the other always yet again: this joyfulness and that sadness. We still do not own either of them. What do we amount to as long as we can get up and a wind, a gleam, a song wrought of the voices of a few birds in the air can seize us and do whatever it wants with us? It is good to hear all of this and to see it and to seize it, not to become numb toward it but on the contrary: everything is to be felt in countless ways in all its variations yet without losing ourselves to it. I once said to Rodin on an April day filled with spring: &#x201c;How this [springtime] dissolves us and how we have to contribute to it with our own juices and make an effort to the point of exhaustion&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you also know this?&#x201d; And he, who surely knew on his own how to seize spring, with a quick glance: &#x201c;Ah&#x2014;I have never paid attention to that.&#x201d; That is what we have to learn: not to pay attention to certain things, to be too concentrated to touch in some sensitive spot the things that can never be reached with one&#x2019;s entire being, to feel everything only with all of life&#x2014;then much (that is too narrow) will be excluded but everything important will take place . . .<br><br>�<br><br>Life is so very true, when taken in its entirety, that even the lie (if it does not emanate from base motives) gloriously shares in this unwavering truth.<br><br>�<br><br>Life goes on, and it goes past a lot of people in a distance, and around those who wait it makes a detour.<br><br>�<br><br>Do not believe that everything strong and beautiful will end up as something &#x201c;ugly and ordinary,&#x201d; as you put it at this moment of inner turmoil&#x2014;it cannot end this way because it does not end at all if it was something strong and beautiful. It continues to work its effects in unceasing transformations; it is only that these transformations frequently so vastly exceed our capacity to grasp and endure them. Frequently, when we are frozen by an event or if an event sheds its leaves and petals in front of our eyes in some other violent way, we dig up the soil around it in horror and shrink back from the ugliness of its roots where that which looks to us like transience lives. We have such a limited capacity to be just toward all phenomena and we are so quick to call ugly, as if turning spitefully and vengefully against ourselves, anything that simply does not correspond to the notion of beauty to which we subscribe at that moment. This is often nothing more than a&#x2014;though often nearly intolerable&#x2014;shifting of our attention; the clustered appearances of life are still so terribly disconnected and incompatible for our perception. Take a walk in the woods on a spring day. It&#x2019;s enough for us to allow our gaze to wander briefly into another category of existence to be facing destruction and disintegration rather than to be looking at life, and to perceive instead of joy, desolation; to feel instead of harmonious vibrations petrified, even exiled, from any insight and participation and commonality. But what does this say against spring? What against the forest? What against us? What, finally, against our possibilities to relate to and to recognize each other? Wherever our attention is thus redirected...</p><h2>Longing for Darkness: Kamante&#39;s Tales from Out of Africa</h2><p>Isak Dinesen and the land and people she loved are nowhere so real and compelling as in <i>Longing for Darkness,</i> written by Dinesen's majordomo, Kamante, and now boasting a smart new cover.

Nesbit (1858-1924) was one of the pioneers of the fantasy genre for children, and the popularity of her classic novels, such as The Railway Children and The Enchanted Castle, has lasted a century.1<br><br>THE BOOK OF BEASTS<br><br>He happened to be building a palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping-rope to the gas-bracket.<br><br>And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in, and said, "Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."<br><br>Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, "Oh, don't, Nurse," and, "I'm sure my ears are quite clean," or, "Never mind my hair, it's all right," and "That'll do."<br><br>"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King," said Nurse.<br><br>The moment Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing-room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts.<br><br>They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said:<br><br>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."<br><br>"Yes, please, sir," said Lionel; "when does it begin?"<br><br>"You will be crowned this afternoon," said the grave _gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other.<br><br>"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.<br><br>"Your Nurse will be removed to the palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the royal robes will cover all that up."<br><br>The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No. 7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.<br><br>Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:<br><br>"Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear. No--there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."<br><br>"Good-bye, ducky," said Nurse; "be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helpings of anything."<br><br>So off went Lionel to be made King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, "Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"<br><br>He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time.<br><br>As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.<br><br>"I thought we were a republic," said Lionel. "I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."<br><br>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy," said the Prime Minister, "and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so much a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket-money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."<br><br>"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grand-father a crown?"<br><br>"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond of books. Almost with his latest breath he sent the crown to be tinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."<br><br>Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the palace nursery.<br><br>Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked. After tea Lionel said:<br><br>"I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"<br><br>"Bless the child," said Nurse, "you don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."<br><br>So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now--when Lionel cried out:<br><br>"Oh, what a worldful of books! Are they yours?"<br><br>"They are yours, Your Majesty," answered the Chancellor. "They were the property of the late King, your great-great--"<br><br>"Yes, I know," Lionel interrupted. "Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."<br><br>"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty," said the Prime Minister, "I should not read these books. Your great--"<br><br>"Yes?" said Lionel, quickly.<br><br>"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little--well, strange."<br><br>"Mad?" asked Lionel, cheerfully.<br><br>"No, no"--both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. "Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was--er--too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."<br><br>Lionel looked puzzled.<br><br>"The fact is," the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, "your great--"<br><br>"Go on," said Lionel.<br><br>"Was called a wizard."<br><br>"But he wasn't?"<br><br>"Of course not--a most worthy King was your great--"<br><br>"I see."<br><br>"But I wouldn't touch his books."<br><br>"Just this one," cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly.<br><br>"I must look at this one," Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: "The Book of Beasts."<br><br>The Chancellor said, "Don't be a silly little King."<br><br>But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive.<br><br>"There," said Lionel, "isn't that lovely? Why--"<br><br>But as he spoke the beautiful butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window.<br><br>"Well!" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, "that's magic, that is."<br><br>But before he had spoken the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him. Under him was written, "Blue Bird of Paradise," and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the blue bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.<br><br>Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said: <br><br>"You're a naughty, disobedient little King," and was very angry indeed.<br><br>"I don't see that I've done any harm," said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all the boys do; he would much rather have been slapped.<br><br>"No harm?" said the Chancellor. "Ah--but what do you know about it? That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page--a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."<br><br>"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you," said Lionel. "Come let's kiss and be friends." So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses, while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts. <br><br>But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts.<br><br>He took it outside onto the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with "Butterfly" and "Blue Bird of Paradise" _underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written "Dragon." The dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed.<br><br>But the next day he wanted another look, so he got the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with...</p><h2>Godforsaken Grapes: A Slightly Tipsy Journey through the World of Strange, Obscure, and Underappreciated Wine</h2><p>There are nearly 1,400 known varieties of wine grapes in the world&#x2014;from altesse to zierfandler&#x2014;but 80 percent of the wine we drink is made from only 20 grapes.

But the long history of Mesopotamian art was marked by change as much as continuity; the region was then as now a center of political conflict, and the Sumerians gave way to a succession of powers both indigenous and foreign, each of which left a cultural imprint.<br> <br>This volume&#x2019;s contributing authors, all art historians and archaeologists specializing in the ancient Near East, provide accessible and lively overviews of the successive phases of this eventful artistic saga. The first two chapters cover the classic&#x201d; age of the great Mesopotamian city-states, from the pre-Sumerian Ubaid culture to Alexander&#x2019;s conquest of Babylon; the remains of this era range from the fabulous treasures of the royal cemeteries at Ur to the mighty ziggurats of Uruk and Babylon. The third chapter concerns the Greco-Mesopotamian art of the Hellenistic dynasty founded by Alexander&#x2019;s general Seleucus; the ruins of Seleucia, his capital on the Tigris, cover some 1500 acres. The fourth chapter investigates the artistic contributions of the two Persian dynasties, the Parthian and the Sassanid, that dominated the region from the first century BC to the seventh century AD and established the soaring iwan, or vaulted portico, as one of its typical architectural forms. The final chapter is devoted to the area&#x2019;s early Islamic period, during which the Abbasid caliphs (eighth to thirteenth century AD) made Iraq the center of the Islamic world, constructing splendid mosques in their capitals of Baghdad and Samarra and elaborating the fantastic arabesques that have never disappeared from Islamic decorative art.<br> <br>The ancient masterpieces discussed in these chapters are depicted in 217 stunning illustrations, most of them full-color photographs, and appended to the main text is a unique visual guide to Iraq&#x2019;s principal archaeological sites, which provides a further 247 black-and-white photographs. With its authoritative, up-to-date texts and this wealth of illustrations, <i>The Art and Architecture of Mesopotamia</i> is an essential publication for anyone with an interest in the cultural heritage of mankind.</p><p><b>Giovanni Curatola,</b> a professor of archaeology and the history of Muslim art at the University of Udine, has curated such exhibitions as Islamic Art in Italy and Shamans and Dervishes of the Steppes. He is presently involved in the effort to preserve Iraq&#x2019;s archaeological heritage.<br> <br> <b>Donny George</b> is the former Director General of Antiquities of Iraq.<br>INTRODUCTION<br> <br>Donny George<br>Former Director General of Antiquities of Iraq<br> <br>Tracing a profile of the Art produced by the Mesopotamian culture, the culture that evolved in "the land between two rivers", the Tigris and the Euphrates, is an undertaking that is at once both arduous and necessary: arduous because an entire library of work has been dedicated to the subject since the first archaeological digs in the 1800s, which revealed to the world what has been defined as the very real cradle of civilization, which it's governmental, economic, and political organizations all having repercussions on the artistic expression of our peoples; necessary because the latest archaeological finds, new discoveries, and growing awareness in the sector requires that definitions and explanations be continually updated in order to cast new light on the quickly developing context and render the entire picture more detailed and comprehensible. This is especially true in that the successive cultural strata discovered at the Mesopotamian sites are now examined taking into consideration the settlements' continuity over the course of millennia. Therefore, the necessary approach is not only multidisciplinary but also open to an analysis of the historical and artistic phenomena characterizing the settlements: it is an attempt to review in a linear fashion, dictated by historical perspectives, events that in reality did not follow a precise pattern. Various competencies are needed in order to incorporate the immense archeological and artistic patrimony of modern-day Iraq into a single analysis. <br> <br>All of this is happening at an exceptional time when the nation is extremely fragile (to use a euphemism) at a stage when it's identity (all the identities, plural, that have contributed to defining this ancient civilization), is being challenged by external factors well known to all. The very image of Iraq today is connected more than ever to its past and not just the abundance of its oil resources. In the last few dramatic years, the activities of the National Museum of Iraq, a glorious avant-gard institution dedicated to the conservation, study and the legacy of the past (made tangible thanks to an immense heritage boasting over half a million finds, many of which are absolute and unique artistic masterpieces), have come to the attention of the word due to the painful events that have inflicted a serious wound on the entire Iraqi population. Both national and international reaction has been consistent with the principal that such a would and such devastation has not been inflicted merely on a distant people, but that this intolerable affront has affected all humanity in one of its highest expressions. The help and support given to the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage and to the museum&#x2014;its direct emanation&#x2014;by various parties and in different ways, and the growing concern of the excessive political authorities in charge of the country toward these institutions, treating them with sensitivity and care, can only be viewed with deeply felt sympathy and constitute a stimulus for the rapid deliverance and rehabilitation of the museum as the main custodian of the historical memory of all, not just the Iraqi population. This work, divided into three main sections, is thus heading in the right direction, and I feel a personal pleasure in contributing to its creations with these introductory pages. I mentioned three main sections: that which we can define as the "classical" antiquity of royal Mesopotamia with its great and celebrated empires, followed by the extraordinary epoch of Hellenism, the prelude of the Parthian and Sasanian ages, and finishing with the Islamic period, generally somewhat absent and neglected, but fundamental to the formation of the Muslim culture and civilization that we know today. Briefly, the depiction of Iraq's significance over the millennia as a center of development and spread of culture is certainly reinforced here.<br> <br>Jean-Daniel Forest and Nathalie Gallois were given the not easy task of summarizing in just a few pages the evolution in all its complexity Mesopotamian age over a vast period of time. The periodization is spot on though still complex and relative: the first chapter begins with its origins and continues to the end of the third millennium BC, while the second chapter deals with the phase from the beginning of the second millennium BC until the fall of Babylon. The importance of the geographical surroundings and canal works are the backdrop against which historical events stand out, starting from the longevity of the Ubaid culture (fifth millennium BC) with its extraordinary ceramics. Uruk (modern Warka), with its large built-up areas, was a city-state ( with an already well-structured state culture) led by a by a monarch, and it underwent three phases of development. The architecture, built of unbaked brick, is extremely important, and to this Forest and Gallois dedicate ample space. However, the buildings are not necessarily connected to a religious function; in some cases they are multi-functional: palace, temple, living quarters, official building. The applied arts of this period are opulent. The so-called "Lady of Uruk" &#x2014;recently restored by conservation lab technicians, who discovered traces of polychrome&#x2014;is an artistic masterpiece. The cylinder seals engraved with high or low reliefs also make up a sizeable corpus, and "allegorical realism" is a good definition given to an important iconographical analysis of their themes of power, strength, and sovereignty. The interpretation of the material comes in the light of knowledge about Neolithic production: one illuminates the other. Under discussion are the most outstanding sites of the Early Dynastic period revealed so far, such as Eridu, Kish and Tell Agrab, but also Mari. It is possible to speak of Sumero-Akkad that, also in iconographic terms, is correctly placed in relation to the Uruk one, of which it could be considered the heir. A detailed analysis of the role of sovereign is given, and Akkadian power is traced with clarity, even along more general lines. A few lines are dedicated to Lagash and the sovereign of Gudea, an obligatory detour thanks to the excavations carried out in Tello (ancient Girsu). In particular, the authors concentrate on&#x2014;and they are right to do so&#x2014;the period known as UR III, probably the height of Sumerian culture. Mention is also made of the centralized structure of the empire and of the literary epic of Gilgamesh, a vital source of information. <br></p><h2>The Armadillo from Amarillo</h2><p>Sasparillo, an armadillo from Texas, leaves his home to find out where on Earth he is, and with the help of a golden eagle, he discovers where he lives--in a city, in a state, in a country, on a continent, on a planet, in the solar system, in the universe. Along the way, Sasparillo learns about geography, history, the environment, and animals native to Texas.<br></p><p>LYNNE CHERRY has devoted her life to sharing her concern about environmental issues with others. Her important children&#39;s books also include The Armadillo from Amarillo and two tales from the Amazon rain forest: The Great Kapok Tree and The Shaman&#39;s Apprentice. She lives in Washington, D.C.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Spectacular watercolor and oil-pastel renditions of Texas scenes combine with the rhymed-verse explorations of a curious armadillo to form an excellent map-skills book for beginners. Sasparillo Armadillo decides to explore his native state, and travels from San Antonio to Amarillo. He's still not sure where in the world he is, so he catches a ride on the back of a golden eagle and eventually boards the space shuttle for an even larger perspective. Cherry's love for the environment, shown in The Great Kapok Tree (1990) and A River Ran Wild (1992, both Harcourt), is evident in this book as well. Fields of bluebonnets and Indian paintbrushes sprawl across borderless, two-page spreads, giving credence to the grandeur of the countryside. Indigenous plants, animals (some endangered), and unique geographical formations are introduced via inset postcards that Sasparillo sends to his cousin Brillo in Philadelphia. An author's note is packed with more cultural, historical, and scientific information, disclaiming some of the fantasy elements but assuring readers that "the geographical information in the text is accurate."

Black Elk grew up in a time when white settlers were invading the Lakotas' homeland, decimating buffalo herds and threatening to extinguish the Lakotas' way of life. Black Elk and other Lakotas fought back, a dogged resistance that resulted in a remarkable victory at the Little Bighorn and an unspeakable tragedy at Wounded Knee.<p>Beautifully told by the celebrated poet and writer John G.

Whether appreciated as a collaborative autobiography, a history of a Native American nation, or an enduring spiritual testament for all humankind, <i>Black Elk Speaks</i> is unforgettable.</p><p>This special edition features all three prefaces to <i>Black Elk Speaks</i> that John G.

This department was responsible for kidnapping, assassination, sabotage, and guerrilla warfare during World War II, it also set up illegal networks in the United States and Western Europe, and, most crucially, carried out atomic espionage in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada. Sudoplatov served the KGB for over fifty years, at one point controlling more than twenty thousand guerrillas, moles, and spies. <p>But his involvement with the most nefarious Soviet activities-- and the rulers who ordered them-- made Sudoplatov an unwanted witness, and he was arrested in 1953 after Beria's fall. Despite torture and solitary confinement he refused to "confess", disavowing any criminal actions. He spent fifteen years in prison, then struggled two decades more for rehabilitation. </p><p>"Special Tasks" is an astonishing memoir and a singular historical document of a man who knew and did too much for the Soviet empire.</p>This secret policeman's memoir contains explosive material. The atomic bomb secrets were betrayed not by the Rosenbergs but by none other than Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi. The motivations of octogenarian Sudoplatov, who managed the Soviet nuclear intelligence effort, in choosing to divulge this information now are less important than the news about the services he performed for Stalin and the damage he inflicted on the West. A skilled operative and admitted murderer--whose assassination in 1938 of a Ukrainian nationalist was rewarded by Stalin with his personal summons and then his direct order to liquidate Trotsky--Sudoplatov coldly records killing as a method of rule. The Kremlin intrigues he details will inspire major historical revision, damning, particularly, Khrushchev (here fingered on a few homicides) and, yet again, Beria. Sudoplatov's insights into the Kremlin's intrigues of the 1940s and 1950s, combined with the inevitable reappraisal of the Oppenheimer cause c{&#x201a;}el{&#x160;}ebre (when the physicist was branded a security risk), are astonishing evidence of secret influences in the domestic politics of both the U.S. and the USSR.

Until today. Today, Neta Efheny was going to make a mistake that would change three lives forever and put whole civilizations at risk.<br> <br>A few skyturns from now, as her mission to Ab-Tzenketh came to its violent and wholly unexpected conclusion, Efheny would have just enough time to reflect again upon the error she was about to make, the uncharacteristic lapse of attention that would cost at least one life. Sitting on a remote hillside, with a terrified workmate and a hostile and desperate ally, Efheny would think about the steps she had taken that had brought her to this pass. She would watch the twin moons silvering the dark expanse of the lagoon, and she would realize that something in her had changed that could not be changed back. She would suddenly understand the extent to which she had acclimated. She would understand that she had gone native. Step by incremental step, move by minute move, Neta Efheny had settled into her place in Tzenkethi society.<br> <br>That was why she had missed the obvious, which, in retrospect, had been staring her in the face for the best part of four months. Initially, she had been dazzled by Ab-Tzenketh. She had learned to keep her head down, and had kept it lowered for so long that she was barely able to lift it again&#x2014;it is difficult to see what is staring you in the face if you are looking at the ground.<br> <br>There were good reasons why this had happened, reasons Efheny would understand very well. Tzenkethi society maintained strict boundaries between its echelons. The bioengineering programs instituted decades ago by the ruling cohorts were attempting to embed these distinctions down at a genetic level. As the programs bore fruit, generation after generation, it was a rare Tzenkethi service grade who found herself lifted by her test scores to a higher function.<br> <br>These days, most Tzenkethi felt uneasy about too much proximity to those outside their echelon, an unease that surely went well beyond cultural taboo. One&#x2019;s pulse quickened and one&#x2019;s luminosity lessened at the sight of a steely skinned enforcer, not simply because one knew what an enforcer was empowered to do but also because one&#x2019;s body communicated it, physically.<br> <br>Each year, the Tzenkethi leaders believed that they were coming closer to eradicating the effects of nurture upon their population, and that soon nature would control everything. So they would have been horrified to discover Neta Efheny, and for more reasons than the obvious. That she was a Cardassian spy who, for the last two years, had been successfully placed in one of the most sensitive government departments on the Tzenkethi homeworld would have been alarming. But to find something at the heart of their society that transgressed the natural order of things? That would be revolting.<br> <br>Efheny had always been fascinated by the Tzenkethi and their rigid social system. Cardassian to the core (whatever her current physical appearance and bioreadings might suggest), she thoroughly approved of the stability achieved by such carefully designed and maintained hierarchies. The chaos of her own world&#x2019;s recent history made her crave that stability more than she perhaps understood. And she&#x2019;d found, over the months embedded on Ab-Tzenketh, that what appeared from the outside to be a monolithic caste system in fact allowed for great variation: differences not just in dialects, for example, but also in tone of voice, or pronunciations of words, or the degree of light emitted from one&#x2019;s luciferous skin that conveyed deep subtleties. Not even the work that Efheny had done for the thesis that had won her this posting (&#x201c;Toward a Typology of Social Stratification Among the Tzenkethi&#x201d;) had prepared her for the rich intricacy of everyday life here. This civilization, Efheny often reflected as she performed her mundane tasks, was like a great symphony in which even the lowliest server contributed to the great harmonic whole.<br> <br>These were the kinds of thoughts that filled Efheny&#x2019;s head when she was not listening for instructions from her superiors or concentrating on her work. This was probably why she had almost forgotten herself, and was certainly why she had almost missed the obvious. She was too busy keeping her head down and too busy being dazzled. Because sometimes&#x2014;just sometimes&#x2014;Efheny forgot. Forgot that her cover identity designated her Ata, bred to carry out the maintenance work necessary to keep any empire going. Sometimes, when she was busy with her tasks, a Fel problem solver or Kre administrator would come down from his or her station on the superior deck, and Efheny would not be able to resist lifting her head just a little to catch a glimpse of these magnificent beings, with their phosphorescent skin and long, strong bodies. Sometimes, when her work was done for the day and she was traveling home to her billet, she would marvel at this glorious world&#x2014;sun kissed, shining, and blessed with so much water that a Cardassian could not help but stare, however furtively. Stable, controlled, beautiful&#x2014;no wonder the Tzenkethi systems were policed so jealously by their inhabitants. No wonder they would have been horrified to discover Neta Efheny in their midst, no matter how much she had come to love them.<br> <br>That morning&#x2014;the morning of her terrible, fatal mistake&#x2014;Efheny inched slowly back and forth on her knees along the inferior deck of a conference room, rubbing nutrient gel into its intricate coral floor. This had been her function since arriving on Ab-Tzenketh. As Mayazan Ret Ata-E (Ret to designate her as one who received her orders directly from any Ter leader; E to indicate the quality of her genetic stock), Efheny was part of a work unit assigned to maintain a series of chambers that made up a division of the Department of the Outside. In these chambers, Fel problem solvers and Kre administrators of the governing echelon met and formulated briefing documents on Tzenkethi policy toward foreign powers to be passed farther up to the court, where they might even reach the ear of the Autarch himself. As an undercover operative for the Cardassian Intelligence Bureau, Neta Efheny&#x2019;s task was to keep as close to these discussions as possible, log everything on the numerous audiovisual recording devices implanted in her person, and transmit these files back to the analysts at the embassy. Neither task made much in the way of intellectual demands, although the maintenance work required physical activity, however repetitive. But as both Efheny and Mayazan, she was a function more than a person.<br> <br>Pausing for a moment to examine her cloth, which seemed to be running low on the embedded chemical cleansing agents, Efheny saw, from the corner of her eye, the familiar figure of the leader of her work unit, Hertome Ter Ata-C. Hertome&#x2019;s genetic profile gave him a slight edge over lower-grade Atas when it came to height, and his Ter designation allowed him to emit a coppery hue to distinguish him from the duller browns of his Ata inferiors. He was also allowed to stand without formal permission when higher functions were nearby.<br> <br>Today, he was waiting near the point where the gravitational field of the anterior deck met that of the superior deck. He had paused in his task of prepping the surfaces of the anterior deck for cleaning and was listening hard to all that was being said by the higher grades above.<br> <br>Efheny gaped. What was he doing? Such an error might easily lead him to be censured. But Efheny&#x2019;s dismay ran deeper than that. Hertome&#x2019;s brazenness seemed almost inconceivable. No true C grade would imagine doing such a thing. Whatever those above were discussing was their concern, not his, and best left to their superior capabilities. Efheny, shocked out of maintaining her normal deferential stance, stopped what she was doing and stared at him.<br> <br>It was an error that might well have proved fatal for both of them. Fortunately for Efheny, the four other members of the unit were busy with their tasks and did not notice what occurred next between their two workmates. As if suddenly aware that he was being watched, Hertome Ter Ata-C turned his head and stared directly down at Efheny, kneeling on the inferior deck and staring up at him. He had green eyes, ovoid, and flecked with gold, ordinary enough for a Tzenkethi&#x2014;but somehow, unmistakably, not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Efheny clenched her jaw. Seeing the movement, Hertome blinked&#x2014;once, twice&#x2014;and then, from the narrowing of his eyelids, Efheny knew that he&#x2019;d guessed that she too was not all that she seemed. She cursed under her breath. She had stared up at him for too long, far longer than any true Tzenkethi server of her grade would at a superior.<br> <br>In a few short seconds, she had given herself away.<br> <br>But then, so had he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>How had she not seen this? Hertome had been her superior for eight twin-months. How had she not known? He was human!<br> <br>&#x201c;Mayazan,&#x201d; said Hertome in a soft, firm voice pitched to convey his authority over her but not to interfere with the important business of their superiors working above, &#x201c;am I to expect a request of you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The use of her name, the personal pronouns, and the formality of his sentence structure reminded Efheny of the parts they were meant to be playing. In fact, it was a most appropriate communication between them, mindful of the differences in their respective grades but granting her the opportunity to speak. Efheny made a gesture of respectful supplication, dimmed further what glow was emitting from her skin, and held up her cloth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ap-Rej,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;this one must request a replacement in order to continue to perform her function satisfactorily.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a moment, Hertome did not move, then he nodded toward their supplies. &#x201c;An acceptable request,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Take a new cloth, and be quick about it, Mayazan. Lazy hands serve no purpose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And this one&#x2019;s purpose is to serve.&#x201d; Efheny stood up and hurried across to their supplies. Within moments she was back on her knees, head down, furiously rubbing the nutrient gel into the coral of the inferior deck. Beside her, one of her workmates, Corazame Ret Ata-E, began to sing, softly, a tune that had been very popular among the Ata a twin-month ago. Soon the other two deck workers were singing along with her, and Efheny joined in too:<br> <br>Like the moons that hand by hand traverse the sky,<br> <br>Like the waves that ebb and flow upon the shore,<br> <br>These ones know,<br> <br>These ones know,<br> <br>There is an order and a purpose for all things.<br> <br>Eventually Hertome and the other wall worker provided harmonies. By all outward appearances, they were a happy and productive unit, and no doubt the Fel and Kre work groups sitting above were comforted to hear the simple chant being murmured below them. Usually Efheny was soothed by participating in these songs, but today her stomach turned queasily, and her hands shook as she cleaned. Because she knew that her immediate superior in Maintenance Unit 17 at the Department of the Outside was not Hertome Ter Ata-C but a Federation agent, name unknown. The question now was: Which of them would be first to act on this new information? Which was going to blink first?<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>It&#x2019;s the little things that kill, thought Beverly Crusher, pushing her mug farther across the table, out of reach of Ren�&#x2019;s questing, vulnerable hands. The things you don&#x2019;t notice until they&#x2019;re hurtling toward you. The tiny things you forget about until all of a sudden they&#x2019;re critical.<br> <br>Ren�, thwarted in his mission to take possession of her mug, began to frown. Expertly, Crusher picked up his small cup and put it down in front of him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Juice, sweetheart!&#x201d; she said. Eagerly, the little boy took the cup. He drank thirstily and gave a wide smile that made his mother&#x2019;s spirits soar.<br> <br>Across the table of the quarters that they shared on the Enterprise, a padd in one hand and his meal forgotten in front of him, her husband sighed deeply.<br> <br>&#x201c;Problem?&#x201d; Crusher said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You could say that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cardassians,&#x201d; Jean-Luc Picard said brusquely. He put down the padd, stood up, and crossed the room to use the companel on the desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Crusher followed him across the room. &#x201c;Yes. I can see how that might be a problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>The screen on the companel shimmered, and then Admiral Akaar appeared, stern and unyielding. Unconsciously, Crusher reached up to straighten her uniform, before remembering she was off-duty, in her quarters, and dressed for dinner with a two-year-old.<br> <br>&#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; Akaar said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a little change of plan. Cardassians,&#x201d; he added, steely eyed and wry faced.<br> <br>Crusher heard her husband sigh, just a little. A complication of Cardassians&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, that would be the collective noun. Picard opened his palm to invite the admiral to elucidate. &#x201c;Please, go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They want their people to come along on the mission. When you get to Starbase 66 to pick up the Ferengi and Federation representatives, there&#x2019;ll be a Cardassian diplomat and her team to pick up too. Negotiator Detrek. If it&#x2019;s any consolation, she&#x2019;s very experienced. A democrat too. First appointed during the Rejal administration, and then a favorite of Alon Ghemor. In other words, our kind of Cardassian.&#x201d;<br> <br>To Crusher&#x2019;s eyes, her husband did not look particularly appeased by Detrek&#x2019;s impeccable credentials as a democrat. &#x201c;Our preliminary exchanges with the Venetan government have been marked by a distinct frost, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It might not be wise to add more people at such a late stage. It could be construed as undue pressure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or construed as a signal of how seriously not just two but three other powers on their borders are taking their current dalliance with the Tzenkethi.&#x201d; Akaar sighed. &#x201c;I know this will be a tough sell, Jean-Luc, but I have our relations with the Cardassians to think of. As their ambassador is constantly reminding us, they are our allies these days. And when he&#x2019;s not banging that drum, he&#x2019;s indicated in innumerable ways&#x2014;stopping short of saying it outright, of course&#x2014;that his government will take the worst kind of message away from any refusal to allow their people to join in this mission to Venette. Since we&#x2019;re counting allies pretty much on the fingers of one hand right now, the president has agreed to their request.&#x201d; He frowned. &#x201c;She said she would throw in a brass band if they asked. So I&#x2019;m afraid Cardassians are going to be there at the negotiating table, and you and the rest of the team will have to look as if that was the plan all along.&#x201d; Akaar&#x2019;s eyes flicked sideways slightly. &#x201c;Is Doctor Crusher there? I&#x2019;d like to speak to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Picard, quirking up his eyebrows, gestured to Crusher. Quickly, she concealed a sticky bright blue plastic spoon in her pocket, and came into view.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I help, Admiral?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Doctor, I&#x2019;d like you to take Lieutenant Chen&#x2019;s place on this mission.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know Chen would do a good job, but I want you there.

With the first pick, the Chargers chose quarterback Eli Manning, the brother of perhaps the best quarterback in the league, Peyton Manning, and the son of longtime NFL quarterback Archie Manning. The Giants held the number four pick and were in the market for a premier quarterback as well. It was no secret they coveted Manning.</p><p>During the 15 minutes the Giants had to make their selection, they were ambushed with two very different options. Option 1 was to make a trade with San Diego in which the Giants would first draft Philip Rivers &#x2014; considered the second best quarterback in the draft &#x2014; and then swap him for Manning plus give up their third-round pick (number 65) that year as well as their first- and fifth-round picks in the 2005 draft. Option 2 was to trade down with the Cleveland Browns, who held the seventh pick and also wanted a quarterback. At number seven, the Giants probably would draft the consensus third best quarterback in the draft, Ben Roethlisberger. In exchange for moving down, the Giants would also receive from Cleveland their second round pick (number 37) that year.</p><p>The Giants chose the first option, which meant they effectively considered Manning to be worth more than Roethlisberger and four additional players.</p><p>To the two economists, however, this seemed like an extraordinarily steep price. But after collecting data from the NFL draft over the previous 13 years and looking at trades made on draft day as well as the compensation &#x2014; salaries plus bonuses &#x2014; paid to top picks, they found that the Manning trade was anything but unusual. As a matter of routine, if not rule, teams paid huge prices in terms of current and future picks to move up in the draft. They also paid dearly for contracts with those players.</p><p>Not only did Manning cost the Giants four other players &#x2014; one of whom turned out to be All Pro linebacker Shawne Merriman &#x2014; but he was also given a six-year, $54-million contract. Compare this to Roethlisberger&#x2019;s compensation. Ultimately drafted 11th by the Steelers, he received $22.26 million over six years.</p><p>Thaler and Massey found that historically, the number one pick in the draft is paid about 80% &#x2014; 80%! &#x2014; more than the 11th pick on the initial contract. The economists also found that the inflated values teams were assigning to high picks were remarkably, if not unbelievably, consistent. No matter the circumstances or a team&#x2019;s needs, teams routinely assigned the same value to the same pick.</p><p>Thaler and Massey compared the values teams placed on picks &#x2014; either in terms of the picks and players they gave up or in terms of compensation &#x2014; with the actual performance of the players. They then compared those numbers with the performance of the players given up to get those picks. For example, in the case of Manning, how did his performance over the next five years compare with that of Rivers plus the performances of the players chosen with the picks the Giants gave San Diego? Likewise, how did those numbers stack up against Ben Roethlisberger&#x2019;s stats and those of the players the Giants could have had with the additional picks they would have received from Cleveland?</p><p>The economists looked at each player&#x2019;s probability of making the roster, his number of starts, and his likelihood of making the Pro Bowl. They found that higher picks were better than lower picks on average and that first rounders on average post better numbers than second rounders, who in turn post better stats than third-round draft picks, and so on.</p><p>The problem was that they weren&#x2019;t that much better. Even looking position by position, the top draft picks are overvalued. How much better is the first quarterback or receiver taken than the second or third quarterback or receiver? Not much. The researchers concluded the following:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The probability that the first player drafted at a given position is better than the second player drafted at the same position is only 53%, that is, slightly better than a tie. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The probability that the first player drafted at a position is better than the third player drafted at the same position is only 55%. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The probability that the first player drafted at a position is better than the fourth player drafted at the same position is only 56%. <br><br>In other words, selecting the consensus top player at a specific position versus the consensus fourth best player at that position increases performance, measured by the number of starts, by only 6%. And even this is understating the case, since the number one pick is afforded more chances/more starts simply because the team has invested so much money in him. Yet teams will end up paying, in terms of both players and dollars, as much as four or five times more to get that first player relative to the fourth player. Was Manning really 50% better than Rivers and twice as good as Roethlisberger? You&#x2019;d be hard put to convince anyone that Manning is appreciably more valuable than Rivers or Roethlisberger; in any event, he&#x2019;s certainly not twice as valuable.</p><p>Yet this pattern persists year after year. Is having the top pick in the NFL draft such a stroke of good fortune? It&#x2019;s essentially a coin flip, but not in the traditional sense. Heads, you win a dime; tails, you lose a quarter. Massey and Thaler go so far as to contend that once you factor in salary, the first pick in the entire draft is worth less than the first pick in the second round.</p></p><h2>Homes of New York and Connecticut (Architectural Treasures of Early America Vol. 5)</h2><p>254 pages - photo illustrated with floor plans and diagrams</p><p></p><h2>The Tiny Wish (A Wish Book)</h2><p><b>The kind and brave heroine of the bestselling <i>The Christmas Wish </i>returns in a springtime adventure!&nbsp;<br></b><br>When Anja wishes to be tiny to win a game of hide-and-seek, her wish comes true!

Over the course of a few days a number of disturbing messages are slipped into his box, messages of portentous and malicious intent referring to the Black Death. Strange marks have also appeared on the doors of several buildings: symbols once used to ward off the plague. Detective Commissaire Adamsberg begins to sense a connection, even a grotesque menace. Then charred and flea-bitten corpses are found. The press seizes on their plague-like symptoms, and the panic sets in.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Fred Vargas was born in Paris in 1957. As well as being a best-selling author in France, she is a historian and archaeologist by training.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>I<br><br></b><i>When manie woormes breede of putrefaction of the earth: toade stooles and rotten herbes abound: The fruites and beastes of the earth are unsavoury: The wine becomes muddie: manie birds and beastes flye from that place<br></i><br><b>II</b><br><br>Joss's settled view was that folk walk faster in Paris than they do in Le Guilvenec, the fishing village where he&#x2019;d grown up. They would steam down Avenue du Maine every day at three knots. This Monday morning, though, Joss himself was doing almost three and a half, trying to make up the twenty minutes he&#x2019;d lost because of that blasted coffee.<br><br>It hadn&#x2019;t surprised him one bit. Joss had always known that objects large and small have secret, vicious lives of their own. He could perhaps make an exception for pieces of fishing tackle that had never taken him on in the living memory of the Brittany fleet; but otherwise the world of things was manifestly focused on making man&#x2019;s life sheer misery. The merest slip of a hand can give a supposedly inanimate object enough freedom of movement to set off a chain of catastrophes which may peak at any point on the Murphy Scale, from &#x201c;Damn Nuisance&#x201d; to &#x201c;Bloody Tragedy&#x201d;. Corks provide a simple illustration of the basic pattern, viz. a wine cork dropped from the table never rolls back to nestle at the boot of whoever let it slip. Oh no, its evil mind always elects to reside behind the stove, like a spider looking for inaccessible sanctuary. The errant cork thus plunges its hereditary hunter, Humankind, into a trial of strength. He has to move the stove and the gas connection out of the wall; he bends down to seize the miscreant bung and a pot falls off the hob and scalds his head. But this morning&#x2019;s case arose from a more complex concatenation. It had begun with the tiniest error in Joss&#x2019;s calculation of the trajectory required to shift a used coffee filter paper to the bin. It landed just off target; the flip-top lurched sideways then swung back and scattered wet ground coffee all around the kitchen floor. Thus do Things transform justified resentment of their human slavemasters into outright revolt; thus do they force men, women and children, in brief but acutely significant bursts, to squirm and scamper like dogs. Joss didn&#x2019;t trust inanimates, not one bit; but he didn&#x2019;t trust men either, nor did he trust the sea. The first could drive you crazy; the second could steal your soul; and the last could take your life.<br><br>Joss was an old and seasoned hand who knew when to yield, so he got down on all fours and cleaned up the coffee mess, grain by tiny grain. Since he did his penance without complaint, the thing-force receded behind its usual sandbank. The breakfast incident was quite negligible in itself, just a nuisance, but Joss wasn&#x2019;t fooled. It was a clear reminder that the war between men and things was far from over, and that men were not always the victors, far from it. A reminder of tragedies past, of ships unmasted, of trawlers smashed, and of his boat, the <i>Nor'easter</i>, that had started taking water at 0300on August 23, in the Irish Sea, with eight crew on board. Yet Joss had always indulged his old trawler&#x2019;s most hysterical demands; man and boat had always treated each other with kindness and consideration far beyond the call of duty. Until that infernal storm when Joss had suddenly got angry and pounded the gunwale with his fist. The <i>Nor&#x2019;easter</i>, which was already listing heavily to starboard, started shipping water at the stern. The engine flooded, and the boat drifted all night long, with the crew baling non-stop, until it came to a grinding halt on a reef at dawn, with two men lost overboard. Fourteen years had gone by since that sad day. Fourteen years since Joss had beaten a lesson into the shipowner&#x2019;s thick skull. Fourteen years since he&#x2019;d left Le Guilvenec after doing nine months for GBH and attempted manslaughter. Fourteen years since almost his entire life had gone down that unplugged hole in the hull.<br><br>Joss gritted his teeth as he made good speed along Rue de la Ga�t�, choking back the anger that surged up inside him every time the <i>Nor&#x2019;easter</i>, Lost at Sea, breasted a wave of his thoughts. But it wasn&#x2019;t really the <i>Nor&#x2019;easter </i>he was angry with. That good old ship had only reacted to the punch he had given it by shifting its aged and rotting timbers. He was sure the ship hadn&#x2019;t realised what the consequences of her brief rebellion would be, because she had had no idea just how old and run-down she really was, nor had she grasped how heavy the sea was that night. The trawler certainly hadn&#x2019;t meant to kill the two sailors; she was surely full of remorse as she lay like an idiot at the bottom of the Irish Sea. Joss often talked to her, mumbling words of comfort and forgiveness. He reckoned the old girl must have found peace by now and made a new life for herself at full fathom five, just as he had up here, in Paris.<br><br>Making peace with the owner, on the other hand, was out of the question.<br><br>&#x201c;Come off it, Cap&#x2019;n Le Guern,&#x201d; he used to say with a hearty clap on Joss&#x2019;s shoulder, &#x201c;you can keep the old girl going for another ten years, no doubt about it. She&#x2019;s a sturdy ship and you&#x2019;re her master.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The <i>Nor&#x2019;easter</i>&#x2019;s no longer safe,&#x201d; Joss kept on telling him. &#x201c;The hull&#x2019;s out of true and the boards are warping. The flooring of the hold has worked loose. I&#x2019;ll not answer for what she might do in a gale. And the lifeboats wouldn&#x2019;t pass inspection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know my ships, Cap&#x2019;n,&#x201d; rasped the owner. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re afraid of the <i>Nor&#x2019;easter</i>, that&#x2019;s fine by me. I&#x2019;ve got ten others who&#x2019;d take your cap at a moment&#x2019;s notice. Men made of sterner stuff who don&#x2019;t grouse about safety regulations like those wimps at the inspectorate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got seven lads on board.&#x201d;<br><br>The owner brought his fleshy, glowering face right close up to Joss&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;If you so much as whisper what&#x2019;s on your mind to the harbour master, Joss Le Guern, you&#x2019;ll be out on your ear as fast as you can say sea shells. Right round the coast, from Brest to Saint-Nazaire, it&#x2019;ll be &#x2018;Sorry, nothing doing&#x2019;. So if you want my advice &#x2013; think again.&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, Joss was really sorry he hadn&#x2019;t done him in right and proper the day after the shipwreck, instead of only breaking one of his legs and fracturing his sternum. But his crewmen &#x2013; it took four of them &#x2013; pulled Joss off his prey. Don&#x2019;t ruin your own life, Joss, they said. They blocked him and then held him down. Later, they stopped him slaughtering the owner and all his henchmen, who&#x2019;d blacklisted him when he came out of prison. Joss bawled the fact that the port authority fat cats were on the owners&#x2019; payrolls in so many bars that he made being taken back into the merchant navy simply impossible. Blackballed in one port after another, Joss jumped on the Paris express one Tuesday morning and landed &#x2013; like so many Bretons before him &#x2013; on the forecourt of Gare Montparnasse, leaving behind a wife who&#x2019;d already taken her leave, and nine men to slay.<br><br>As the Edgar-Quinet crossing hove into view, Joss stuffed his ancient hard feelings into a mental back pocket, and clapped on full steam. He was running late, as the business with the coffee slops and the wars of the things had wasted at least fifteen minutes. Punctuality was a key part of his work, and it mattered very much that the first edition of his newscast should take place every day at 0830 sharp, with the second edition on the dot of 1235 and the late final at 1810. That's when the street was at its busiest, and in this town people were in too much of a hurry to put up with the slightest delay.<br><br>Joss took the urn down from the tree where he strung it up overnight with a double bowline and two bike locks to secure it. This morning there wasn&#x2019;t a lot inside, so it wouldn&#x2019;t take too long to sort. He smiled to himself as he took the urn into the back room that Damascus let him use in his shop. There were still a few decent fellows left, he thought, people like Damascus who would let you have a key and a bit of table space, without worrying about you running off with the till. Talk about a stupid name, though! Damascus was the manager of Rolaride, the skate shop on the square, and he let Joss use the place to prepare his newscasts out of the rain. Rolaride &#x2013; that&#x2019;s another ludicrous moniker, if you ask me.<br><br>Joss took the padlocks off the urn. It was a big wooden lap-jointed box that he&#x2019;d made with his own fair hand, and dubbed <i>Nor&#x2019;easter II</i> in memory of his dearly departed. A great fishing vessel of the deep-sea fleet might not have thought it an honour to have her name perpetuated by a modest letter box, but <i>Nor&#x2019;easter II</i> was no ordinary mail drop. It was a very clever seven-year-old indeed, born of a brilliant idea that had allowed Joss to pull himself up the ladder again after two years&#x2019; unemployment, six months spinning cables and three years in a cannery. It was on a gloomy December night in a Paris caf� that Joss had been struck by sheer genius. The place was full of nostalgic Breton exiles droning on about their families and home ports, about when the fishing was good and the onions too. Some boozed-up old sailor mentioned the village of Pont l&#x2019;Abb�, and all of a sudden Joss&#x2019;s great-great-grandfather, born at Locmariain 1832, sprang out of his head, propped himself up at the bar, and said good evening.<br><br>"Good evening to you," said Joss, tightening his grip on his glass.<br><br>"You do rememberme, don't you?"<br><br>"Sort of . . . " Joss mumbled. "You died before I was born. I didn&#x2019;t shed no tears.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Joss Le...</p><h2>The Flame Bearer (The Last Kingdom Series, Book 10) (The Last Kingdom Series)</h2><p>Flame Bearer the Last Kingdom Series, Book 10</p><p>Bernard Cornwell was born in London, raised in Essex andworked for the BBC for eleven years before meeting Judy, hisAmerican wife.

All the quilts are pleasing and look much more complicated than they are. I will never cut a fabric again without cutting a 2 1/2" strip first.

The most virulent form of this ongoing persecution was the practice of lynching carried out by mob rule, often as local law enforcement officials looked the other way. During the 1880s and 1890s, more than 100 African Americans per year were lynched, and in 1892 alone the toll of murdered men and women reached a peak of 161.In that awful year, the twenty-three-year-old Ida B. Wells, the editor of a small newspaper for blacks in Memphis, Tennessee, raised one lone voice of protest. In her paper she charged that white businessmen had instigated three local lynchings against their black competitors. In retaliation for her outspoken courage a goon-squad of angry whites destroyed her editorial office and print shop, and she was forced to flee the South and move to New York City.So began a crusade against lynching which became the focus of her long, active, and very courageous life. In New York she began lecturing against the abhorrent vigilante practice and published her first pamphlet on the subject called Southern Horrors. After moving to Chicago and marrying lawyer Ferdinand Barnett, she continued her campaign, publishing A Red Record in 1895 and Mob Rule in New Orleans, about the race riots in that city, in 1900.All three of these documents are here collected in this work, a shocking testament to cruelty and the dark American legacy of racial prejudice. Anticipating possible accusations of distortion, Wells-Barnett was careful to present factually accurate evidence and she deliberately relied on southern white sources as well as statistics gathered by the Chicago Tribune. Using the words of white journalists, she created a damning indictment of unpunished crimes that was difficult to dispute since southern white men who had witnessed the appalling incidents had written the descriptions.Along with her husband she played an active role in the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Due to her efforts, the NAACP launched an intensive campaign against lynching after World War I.Her work remains important to this day not only as a cry of protest against injustice but also as valuable historical documentation of terrible crimes that must never be forgotten. This new edition is enhanced by an introduction by Patricia Hill Collins, professor and chair of the Department of African American Studies at the University of Cincinnati.</p><p><b>Ida B.

His virtuous Justine kept to the rules laid down by men, her reward rape and humiliation; his Juliette, Justine's triumphantly monstrous antithesis, viciously exploited her sexuality. This is a world where all tenderness is false, and all beds are minefields. But now Sade has met his match. With invention and genius, celebrated novelist Angela Carter takes on these figments of his extreme imagination and transforms them into symbols of our time&#x2014;the Hollywood sex goddesses, mothers and daughters, pornography, even the sacred shrines of sex and marriage lie devastatingly exposed before our eyes. Carter delves into the viscera of our distorted sexuality and reveals a stunning vision of love that admits neither the conqueror nor the conquered.

An estimated forty million people died as the epidemic raged. Children were left orphaned and families were devastated. As many American soldiers were killed by the 1918 flu as were killed in battle during World War I. And no area of the globe was safe. Eskimos living in remote outposts in the frozen tundra were sickened and killed by the flu in such numbers that entire villages were wiped out.<br><br>Scientists have recently rediscovered shards of the flu virus frozen in Alaska and preserved in scraps of tissue in a government warehouse. Gina Kolata, an acclaimed reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>, unravels the mystery of this lethal virus with the high drama of a great adventure story. Delving into the history of the flu and previous epidemics, detailing the science and the latest understanding of this mortal disease, Kolata addresses the prospects for a great epidemic recurring, and, most important, what can be done to prevent it.<br><br></p><p>Feeling tired, achy, and congested? You'll hope not after reading science writer Gina Kolata's engrossing <i>Flu</i>, a fascinating look at the 1918 epidemic that wiped out around 40 million people in less than a year and afflicted more than one of every four Americans. This tragedy, just on the heels of World War I and far more deadly, so traumatized the survivors that few would talk about it afterward. Kolata reports on the scientific investigation of this bizarre outbreak, in particular the attempts to sequence the virus' DNA from tissue samples of victims. She also looks at the social and personal effects of the disease, from improved public health awareness to the loss of productivity. (The disease affected 20- to 40-year-olds disproportionately.)<p> How could this disease, now almost trivial to healthy young people, have become so virulent? The answer is complex, invoking epidemiology, immunology, and even psychology, but Kolata cuts a swath through medical papers and statistical reports to tell a story of an out-of-control virus exploiting an exhausted world on the brink of transition into modern society. Through letters, interviews, and news reports, she pieces together a cautionary tale that captures the horror of a devastating illness. Research marches onward, but we're still at the mercy of something as simple as the flu. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><b>Gina Kolata</b> is a science reporter for <i>The New York Times</i> and the author of <i>Clone: The Road to Dolly </i>and<i> Sex in America.</i> She lives in Princeton, New Jersey.<br><br></p><h2>Global Peace and the Rise of Antichrist</h2><p>Examines recent world events in the light of biblical prophecy foretelling the end of the world</p><p></p><h2>The Oregon Trail Romance Collection: 9 Stories of Life on the Trail into the Western Frontier</h2><p>Nine romantic adventures take readers along for a ride on the Oregon Trail where daily challenges force travelers to evaluate the things that are most precious to them&#x2014;including love.

When he died suddenly, the townfolk were sad but not surprised. Just shy of sixty-five, Newquist worked too hard, drank too much, and exercised too little.<br><br>Newquist's widow, Selma, didn't doubt the coroner's report. But still, she couldn't help wondering what had so bothered Tom in the last six weeks of his life. What was it that had made him prowl restlessly at night and brood constantly? Determined to help Selma find the answer, Kinsey Millhone sets up shop in Nota Lake, where she finds that looking for a needle in a haystack can draw blood--very likely, her own. . . .</p><p>"Suppose we could peer through a tiny peephole in time and chance upon a flash of what was coming up in the years ahead?" The questioner is Kinsey Millhone, middle-aged, two-time divorcee detective and junk food junkie star of Sue Grafton's popular "alphabet" mysteries; the book is <i>'N' Is for Noose</i>. If Kinsey had had just a smidgen of foresight, she would never have taken her current case, handed down to her from her on-again, off-again flame and comrade in arms, Robert Dietz. We encounter the two this time out after Deitz's knee surgery, as Kinsey drives his "snazzy little red Porsche" back to Carson City, where she checks out his digs for the first time. To her surprise, he lives in a palatial penthouse, which--under the unspoken bylaws of investigative etiquette--she qualmlessly snoops through. They sit around for a fortnight playing gin rummy and eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches together, but perennially single Kinsey grows wary: "It was time to hit the road before our togetherness began to chafe." <p> She heads off to meet Dietz's former client, Mrs. Selma Newquist, a devastated widow whose makeup tips seem to come from Tammy Faye Baker. Her husband Tom Newquist, a detective himself, had been working on a mysterious case when he abruptly died of a heart attack. Selma suspects foul play, but bless her, she isn't the brightest star in the sky and can't figure out what Tom was working on even though he's left behind enough paper to fill a recycling truck. Kinsey digs right in and roams the sleepy, one-horse town of Nota Lake for clues, interviewing a colorful cast of in-laws and locals. Beneath the quaint, quiet, country veneer, she unearths a bubbling hotbed of internal strife and familial double-dealing. Was Tom covering up for his partner? Is Selma protecting someone? Grafton's knack for gritty details and realistic characters ("[Selma's] skin tones suggested dark coloring, but her hair was a confection of white-blond curls, like a cloud of cotton candy"), coupled with the fast-paced, believable story line, makes for another delightful, entertaining read. --Rebekah Warren, Bestsellers editor</p>"Book for book, this may be the most satisfying mystery series going."<br>--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><p>"There are few writers able to sustain the solid mixture of detection, narrative energy and cultural observations that one finds so often in Grafton." <br>--<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br></p></p><h2>Edgar and the Tattle-Tale Heart: A BabyLit� Book: Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s &#34;The Tell-Tale Heart&#34; (Babylit First Steps)</h2><p><p>Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Tell-Tale Heart&#x201d;</p> <p>The plucky, mischievous toddler Edgar the Raven is at it again in this spirited story with some important lessons.

My heels stung with blisters. Dusk was falling, and my head was muzzy from the weariness of another long day&#x2019;s walk. Birds cried out overhead, winging to nighttime roosts. They were as eager as I was to get out of the chill.<br><br>We&#x2019;d heard there was a settlement not far along the loch shore, a place where we might perhaps buy shelter with our fast-�shrinking store of coppers. I allowed myself to imagine a bed, a proper one with a straw mattress and a woolen coverlet. Oh, how my limbs ached for warmth and comfort! Foolish hope. The way things were in Alban, people didn&#x2019;t open their doors to strangers. Especially not to disheveled vagrants, and that was what we had become. I was a fool to believe, even for a moment, that our money would buy us time by someone&#x2019;s hearth fire and a real bed. Never mind that. A heap of old sacks in a net-�mending shed or a pile of straw in a barn would do fine. Anyplace out of this wind. Anyplace out of sight.<br><br>I became aware of silence. Father&#x2019;s endless mumbled recounting of past sorrows, a constant accompaniment to our day&#x2019;s journey, had come to a halt, and now he stopped walking to gaze ahead. Between the water&#x2019;s edge and the looming darkness of a steep wooded hillside, I could make out a cluster of dim lights.<br><br>&#x201c;Darkwater settlement,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There are lights down by the jetty. The boat&#x2019;s there!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What boat?&#x201d; I was slow to understand, my mind dreaming of a fire, a bowl of porridge, a blanket. I did not hear the note in his voice, the one that meant trouble.<br><br>&#x201c;Fowler&#x2019;s boat. The chancy-�boat, Neryn. What have we got left&#x2014;how much?&#x201d;<br><br>My heart plummeted. When this mood took him, setting the glitter of impossible hope in his eyes, there was no stopping him. I could not restrain him by force; he was too strong for me. And whatever I said, he would ignore it. But I had to try.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough for two nights&#x2019; shelter and maybe a crust if we&#x2019;re lucky, Father. There&#x2019;s nothing to spare. Nothing until one of us gets some paid work, and you know how likely that is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Give me the bag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Father, no! These coppers are our safe place to sleep. They&#x2019;re our shelter from the wind. Don&#x2019;t you remember what happened last&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me what to do, daughter.&#x201d; His eyes narrowed in a way that was all too familiar. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s better than a drink of ale to warm us up? Besides, I&#x2019;ll double our coppers on the boat. Triple them. Nobody beats me in a game of chance. Would you doubt your father, girl?&#x201d;<br><br>Doubt was hardly the word for what I felt. Yes, he had once been skilled in such games. He&#x2019;d had a reputation as a tricky player, full of surprises. Sorrow and reversal, hardship and humiliation, had eaten up that clever fellow, leaving a pathetic shell, a man who liked his ale too much and could no longer distinguish between reality and wild dream. Father was a danger to himself. And he was a danger to me, for strong drink loosened his tongue, and a word out of place could reveal the gift I fought to hide from the world every moment of every day. He&#x2019;d talk, and someone would tell the Enforcers, and it would all be over for the two of us. But I was heartsick and weary&#x2014;�too weary to fight him any longer.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; I said, handing over the bag. &#x201c;I hate the chancy-�boat. The only chance it will give you tonight is the chance to squander what little we have. If you lose this money, we&#x2019;ll be sleeping out in the open, at the mercy of whoever happens to pass by. If you lose it, you&#x2019;ll lose what little self-�respect you have left. But you&#x2019;re my father, and I can&#x2019;t make your choices for you.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at me directly, just for a moment, and I thought I saw a glimmer of understanding in his eyes, but it was gone as quickly as it had appeared. &#x201c;You hate me,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;You despise your own father.&#x201d;<br><br>I could have told him the truth: that I hated his weakness, that I hated his anger, that the days and months and years of looking after him and keeping him out of trouble and protecting him from himself had worn me down. But I loved him too. He was my father. I loved the man he used to be, and I still hadn&#x2019;t given up hope that, someday, he could be that man again. &#x201c;No, Father,&#x201d; I said, plodding after him as he strode ahead, for the prospect of a game and a win had put new life in his step. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m cold and tired, that&#x2019;s all. Too tired to mind my words.&#x201d;<br><br>As we made our way closer to the lights of the chancy-�boat, which rocked gently in the dark water beside a small jetty, I was aware of pale eyes watching me from the branches of the pines. I did not allow myself a glance toward them. Small feet shuffled in the fallen leaves and pattered along behind us a way, then skipped off into the woods. I did not allow myself to turn back. A whisper teased at me: Neryn! Neryn, we are here! I closed my ears to it. I had been hiding my secret for years, since Grandmother had explained the peril of canny gifts. I had become adept at concealment.<br><br>I stiffened my spine and gritted my teeth. Maybe there would be nobody on the chancy-�boat but its captain, Fowler, who had some understanding of my father&#x2019;s situation. Who would want to spend such a chilly night playing games anyway? Who would be visiting such an out-�of-�the-�way place as Darkwater? We had come here because the settlement lay so far from well-�traveled roads. We had come because nobody knew us in these parts. Except Fowler, and we had not expected him. But Fowler wouldn&#x2019;t talk. He was a bird of passage, a loner.</p></p><h2>A Rabble of Dead Money: The Great Crash and the Global Depression: 1929&#x2013;1939</h2><p>The Great Crash of 1929 profoundly disrupted the United States' confident march toward becoming the world's superpower. The breakneck growth of 1920s America--with its boom in automobiles, electricity, credit lines, radio, and movies--certainly presaged a serious recession by the decade's end, but not a depression. The totality of the collapse shocked the nation, and its duration scarred generations to come. <br> In this lucid and fast-paced account of the cataclysm, award-winning writer Charles R. Morris pulls together the intricate threads of policy, ideology, international hatreds, and sheer individual cantankerousness that finally pushed the world economy over the brink and into a depression. While Morris anchors his narrative in the United States, he also fully investigates the poisonous political atmosphere of postwar Europe to reveal how treacherous the environment of the global economy was. It took heroic financial mismanagement, a glut-induced global collapse in agricultural prices, and a self-inflicted crash in world trade to cause the Great Depression. <br> Deeply researched and vividly told, <i>A Rabble of Dead Money</i> anatomizes history's greatest economic catastrophe--while noting the uncanny echoes for the present.</p><p><b>Charles R.

Her father has walked out, and her anguished mother seeks solace in pills. Her best friend practically abandons her to be with a boyfriend. It seems like Jennie&#39;s real best friend is her diary. Then she meets Mr. Johnstone, the substitute math teacher. Jennie has never met such a charismatic teacher. She feels honored when Mr. J. seems to single her out for special attention, and begins to fantasize about him as her boyfriend. When Mr. J. first reveals his feelings for her, she is thrilled by the relationship that grows outside the classroom walls. Then, slowly, Jennie&#39;s diary becomes a record of her loneliness, pain, and confusion. Will it also offer her a way to escape from this treacherous love?</p><p>Beatrice Sparks is a family and adolescent therapist who edited the diary that formed the basis for <em>Go Ask Alice,</em> and has since edited many diaries on topics such as gangs, AIDS, and teen pregnancy in the 1988 Annie's Baby.

I HATE IT . . . HATE IT . . . HATE IT . . . when they do that!</p><p>I can&#x2019;t understand a single bit of what they are saying, but the feelings come through like giant rocks and electric shocks and fire darts. I want it to stop!!! Stop!!! Stop!!! I hate it! And I <i>hate them for doing it</i>! I don&#x2019;t really hate them. Actually, I want, with all my might, to run into their room and snuggle up in their bed with them. Me in the middle being kissed and hugged and spoiled like when I was little.</p><p>Whatever happened to our loving, happy little family that used to play hide-and-seek in the house and have picnics on the floor in front of the fireplace on rainy days?

Vaughan has many interesting anecdotes of a life that has been full and varied, as evidenced by the fact that he is 85 and still mushing. The story, like the author's life, suffers a letdown when Vaughan returns from Little America to begin a career in advertising. But the expedition account is riveting, and there are hints of later excitement. The book is a bit unfocused, however, and it is uncertain whether this is an autobiography, a biography of Byrd, or an account of a polar exploration.

Selznick, for whom Willson procured women. The starmaker-to-be was therefore on the lookout for promising newcomers&#x2014;as actors, lovers and sometimes both&#x2014;when he received an unsolicited photograph from a movie star hopeful named Roy Scherer. Unbeknownst to Willson, the photograph of the handsome young man with bad teeth would have not only a career-defining impact for himself but, more importantly, redefine Hollywood&#x2019;s concept of the male heartthrob. Roy Scherer became Rock Hudson and for the next twenty-five years Henry Wilson became the man behind movie &#x201c;beefcake.&#x201d;<br><br>The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson delves into Willson&#x2019;s life in explicit, unsparing detail. Variety reporter Robert Hofler deftly chronicles Willson&#x2019;s maneuvers to sidestep the FBI's investigation into Hudson's sex life; the starmaker's use of off-duty L.A.P.D. cops and Mob ties to scare off Hudson's blackmailers; Hudson's "arranged" marriage to Willson's secretary, Phyllis Gates; as well as Hudson&#x2019;s affair with a Universal Pictures vice-president to help secure starring roles in Magnificent Obsession and Giant. Additionally, the book digs into Willson&#x2019;s other star clients, including Robert Wagner, Troy Donahue, Tab Hunter, and John Derek.</p><p>Robert Hofler has been Variety&#39;s New York-based theater reporter for over three years. Previously, he was a senior editor in Variety&#39;s L.A. office. He has also been an editor at Buzz, Life and Us magazines. His articles have appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, the Washington Post and Premiere magazine. He lives in New York City.Those who think Hollywood's current predatory political scene and celebrity partner-swapping activities are new phenomena would be wise to dive into this tell-all tale of Henry Willson, an agent who became a major star maker to actors like Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy Donahue in the 1950s. Rapacious, ambitious and fond of a sex-for-roles strategy, Willson (1911&#x2013;1978) is a compelling character worthy of this extensive biography. His story, too, illustrates the rise of the studio star system, in which actresses were pimped out to movie executives by their agents, and actors married to cover their homosexual liaisons. Hofler, a former <i>Variety </i>senior editor now the publication's theater reporter, delves into this shadowy, sometimes seamy world with particular relish, and his writing has all the sizzle of the films his subjects starred in. He includes interviews with a number of Hollywood insiders (Roddy McDowall and Shirley Temple Black, to name two), and shows remarkable sympathy for Willson, offering a glimpse into a man and an era that may be past, but whose effects linger still.

In a rich blend of social and architectural history, Abbott Lowell Cummings reconstructs, through text and pictures, the framed houses of Massachusetts Bay that reflect the straightforward honesty of our earliest northern settlers and their profound love of craftsmanship.</p><p>A substantial number of the nation's seventeenth-century houses have been preserved in Massachusetts, and Cummings provides illustrations for a majority of them. He describes the dwellings in detail, and includes architectural drawings that were especially commissioned for this book. He demonstrates that the builders were far more sophisticated than previously imagined and that, while maintaining their English timber-building traditions, they were astonishingly adaptable to their new environment.</p><p>Beyond the houses themselves, Cummings discusses evolutions in pioneer life. The most simple kinds of changes in architecture, Cummings shows, indicated singular changes in family living. Such additions as kitchens and parlors, or the moving of the master bedroom to a second floor, suggest shifts in the private and social lives of families.</p><p><i>The Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay</i> is a splendid story of innovations&#x2015; of restless, migratory people and their architectural and social responses to the heavily forested New World. It is the first chapter in the long saga of America's preoccupation with technology as it affected the early American home.</p></p><p>Abbott Lowell Cummings was Executive Director of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England) and a member of the faculty at Antioch College, Boston University, and Yale University.&#x201c;After more than 25 years of research into the houses and the associated documentary material Abbott Cummings has produced a book which deserves the description &#x2018;definitive study&#x2019; ...English scholars will be well served when someone produces a book of this quality concerned with traditional buildings in the old world rather than the new.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Harris</b><b>, </b><b><i>Architectural Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Abbott L. Cummings&#x2019; book is an in-depth history of the framed house almost as if it were a work of art that was losing meaning as the &#x2018;era of technical reproducibility&#x2019; approached... From [his] meticulous technical treatment one learns the unique nature of these pioneer homes... The book concludes by underscoring, from the stylistic viewpoint, a sort of common character in the architecture of Massachusetts Bay which endures until the present. The framed house was not just the link between the Old and New World, it also was the mythical commencement of the American constructional tradition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Domus [Italy]</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This will probably be the definitive book on 17th-century American architecture.

Or with the dozens of other odd creatures it has lured to Plowman's Planet? And if the Glimmung is a god, are its ends positive or malign? Combining quixotic adventure, spine-chilling horror, and deliriously paranoid theology, <b>Galactic Pot-Healer</b> is a uniquely Dickian voyage to alternate worlds of the imagination.</p><p>[headline] A far-out alien farce that could only come from the mind of Philip K.

But from the moment Joe arrives on Plowman s Planet, things start to go awry. Is the Glimmung good or evil? Are Joe and his friends helping to save Plowman s Planet or destroy it?

We meet Sunshine Charley Mitchell, head of the National City Bank, powerful financiers Jack Morgan and Jacob Schiff, Wall Street manipulators such as the legendary Jesse Livermore, and the lavish-living Billy Durant, founder of General Motors. As Klein follows the careers of these men, he shows us how the financial house of cards gradually grew taller, as the irrational exuberance of an earlier age gripped America and convinced us that the market would continue to rise forever. Then, in October 1929, came a "perfect storm"-like convergence of factors that shook Wall Street to its foundations. We relive Black Thursday, when police lined Wall Street, brokers grew hysterical, customers "bellowed like lunatics," and the ticker tape fell hours behind. This is followed by the even worse Bloody Tuesday, when an irrational desire to sell at any price gripped the market and even blue chip stocks plummeted precariously. <br> This compelling history of the Crash--the first to follow the market closely for the two years leading up to the disaster--illuminates a major turning point in our history.</p><p><br><strong>Maury Klein</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Rhode Island and one of the most acclaimed historians of American business at work today. He is the author of many books, including <em>The Life and Legend of Jay Gould</em> (a Pulitzer Prize finalist), <em>Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American</em> <em>Life</em>, and <em>Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War</em>.<br><br>"Klein tells the story of the crash clearly and well, with some especially good pen portraits of characters such as Thomas Lamont, Jesse Livermore, Charley Mitchell and Albert Wiggin (who actually made money short-selling)."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"Land crooks...delusional bank chairman...high-rolling speculators.... The woes of the local shoe-shine man and Groucho Marx get mentioned, too.... Klein offers a swift survey of the lunatic optimism of Wall Street and how it all turned to dust in the closing days of October.... Each chapter resonates with the follies of today."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"A remarkable blend of sharp-eyed business history and keen cultural analysis, <em>Rainbow's End</em> paints the most compelling picture yet of the stock-market crash of 1929. In Maury Klein's able hands, the story of the crash ends up illuminating not just Wall Street in the Jazz Age, but America as well. Boom and bust: Klein gives us both, in all their intoxicating and hysterical glory."--James Surowiecki, Business Columnist, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Well-written, entertaining and detailed.... Klein shows how optimism gradually spawned financial euphoria."--Robert J. Samuelson, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"The great crash of 1929 was one of those sharp breaks in the stream of time when all who were living knew immediately that their world had changed. Many, of course, have written of the crash, but few as well or as authoritatively as Maury Klein in <em>Rainbow's End</em>. He brings a historian's perspective to a complex story while retaining the sense of immediacy that made those terrible days some of the most exciting in American history."--John Steele Gordon, author of <em>The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street As a World Power</em><p></p><br>"A well-written, comprehensible assessment of the 1929 stock -market crash. Klein is an elegant constructor of business histories, and one can read dire warnings between the lines here. A most timely business narrative." --<em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"Klein helps readers better understand the reaction of millions to an event that shook the world....

At the war&#x2019;s end in September 1945, under General MacArthur&#x2019;s media blackout, correspondents were forbidden to enter both Nagasaki and Hiroshima. But instead of obediently staying with the press corps in northern Japan, Weller broke away. The intrepid newspaperman reached Nagasaki just weeks after the atomic bomb hit the city. Boldly presenting himself as a U.S. colonel to the Japanese military, Weller set out to explore the devastation.<br><br>As Nagasaki&#x2019;s first outside observer, long before any American medical aid arrived, Weller witnessed the bomb&#x2019;s effects and wrote &#x201c;the anatomy of radiated man.&#x201d; He interviewed doctors trying to cure those dying mysteriously from &#x201c;Disease X.&#x201d; He typed far into every night, sending his forbidden dispatches back to MacArthur&#x2019;s censors, assuming their importance would make them unstoppable. He was wrong: the U.S. government censored every word, and the dispatches vanished from history.<br><br>Weller also became the first to enter the nearby Allied POW camps. From hundreds of prisoners he gathered accounts of watching the atomic explosions bring an end to years of torture and merciless labor in Japanese mines. Their dramatic testimonies sum up one of the least-known chapters of the war&#x2014;but those stories, too, were silenced.<br><br>It is a powerful experience, more than 60 years later, to walk with Weller through the smoldering ruins of Nagasaki, or hear the sagas of prisoners who have just learned that their torment is over, and watch one of the era&#x2019;s most battle-experienced reporters trying to accurately and unsentimentally convey to the American people scenes unlike anything he&#x2014;or anyone else&#x2014;knew. <br><br>Weller died in 2002, believing it all lost forever. Months later, his son found a fragile copy in a crate of moldy papers. This historic body of work has never been published.<br><br>Along with reports from the brutal POW camps, a stirring saga of the worst of the Japanese &#x201c;hellships&#x201d; which carried U.S. prisoners into murder and even cannibalism, and a trove of Weller&#x2019;s unseen photos, <b>First into Nagasaki</b> provides a moving, unparalleled look at the bomb that killed more than 70,000 people and ended WWII. Amid current disputes over the controlled embedding of journalists in war zones and a government&#x2019;s right to keep secrets, it reminds us how such courageous rogue reporting is still essential to learning the truth.</p><p>GEORGE WELLER was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard in 1929. As an admired but penniless young novelist, he began reporting on Greece and the Balkans for the New York Times in the 1930s, then made his name covering the war for the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>. He won a 1943 Pulitzer Prize for his story of an emergency appendectomy on a submarine in enemy waters. Throughout a long career Weller reported from five continents; he was a Nieman Fellow in 1947 and also won a 1954 George Polk Award. His work includes two highly praised WWII books, <b>Singapore Is Silent</b> and <b>Bases Overseas</b>. He died at his home in Italy, aged 95.<br><br>ANTHONY WELLER, George Weller&#x2019;s son, is the author of three novels&#x2014;<b>The Garden of the Peacocks</b>, <b>The Polish Lover</b>, and <b>The Siege of Salt Cove</b>&#x2014;and a memoir of India and Pakistan called <b>Days and Nights on the Grand Trunk Road</b>. He has traveled widely for numerous magazines and is also a much-recorded jazz and classical guitarist.I<br><br>First into Nagasaki<br><br>(1966)<br><br>Whenever I see the word "Nagasaki," a vision arises of the city when I entered it on September 6, 1945, as the first free westerner to do so after the end of the war. No other correspondent had yet evaded the authorities to reach either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. The effects of the atomic bombs were unknown except for the massive fact that they had terminated the war with two blows in three days. The world wanted to know what the bombs' work looked like from below.*<br><br>I had just escaped the surveillance of General MacArthur's censors, his public relations officers and his military police. MacArthur had placed all southern Japan off limits to the press. Slipping into forbidden Nagasaki, I felt like another Perry, entering a land where my presence itself was forbidden, a land that now had two Mikados, both omnipotent.<br><br>When I walked out of Nagasaki's roofless railroad station, I saw a city frizzled like a baked apple, crusted black at the open core where the searing sun born at Alamogordo had split open the blue sky of midday. I saw the long, crumpled skeleton of the Mitsubishi electrical motor and ship fitting plant, a framework blasted clean of its flesh by the lazy-falling missile floating under a parachute.<br><br>What irony, I thought, in a war of competing velocities, that this slowest-borne of all weapons, falling at a speed little greater than my own descent when I took training as a paratrooper, should in the end out-destroy all the fleetest of the winged killers. The bomb of Nagasaki reversed the rule of war, getting there last and slowest but with the most, a terminal blow riding under a silk handkerchief.<br><br>Even now I see the scorched hills ringing the bottleneck of the port. Along the blistered boulevards the shadows of fallen telegraph poles were branded upright on buildings, the signature of the ray stamped in huge ideograms. I can never forget the hospitals where I heard from X-ray specialists the devouring effects of the ray on the human bloodstream and viscera, analyzed as impassively by the little men in white coats as if it had happened to someone else, not themselves. In the battered corridors of these hospitals, already eroded by man's normal suffering, there was no sorrowful horde. The wards were filled. There was no private place left to die. Consequently the dying were sitting up crosslegged against the walls, holding sad little court with their families, answering their tender questions with the mild, consenting indifference of those whose future is cancelled.<br><br>I felt pity, but no remorse. The Japanese military had cured me of that. After years of unchallenged domination, they were bending a little under the first after-wind of the bombs, a national mistrust, almost contempt, for having led Japan into war. A few sought escape in hara-kiri. The majority blamed the enemy for using weapons that were "unfair."<br><br>Had Japan got these weapons first, would they have been unfair, I asked? Was Pearl Harbor an act of Japanese chivalry? The crafty eyes under the peaked brown caps turned unblinking and blank.<br><br>In the harbor, I remember, there still burned the last altar kindled by the fireball. A small freighter, crisped like dry bacon down to the waterline, still smoked, glowed and puffed. She was a floating lamp, untended, with all her mooring ropes burned outward till the ends fell in the water. But her hot pink hawsers still held. Bobbing there among the debris-littered dark waters, she spread a light that flickered in eerie unison with the candles and kerosene lamps and little flashlights ashore.<br><br>I felt I had a right to be in Nagasaki, closed or not. Four weeks after the two bombs, with no riots or resistance in Japan, it seemed reasonable that MacArthur should lift his snuffer from the two cities. There was a sort of reason for delay, but it had nothing to do with the public's right to know. As something to fall back upon in the event of the failure of the bombs, MacArthur's planners had arranged that the Japanese archipelago was to be invaded in one-two time, first the northern islands and the Tokyo-Yokohama area, and then the south, with the two atomic cities. Japan's surrender made little difference. An incredible six weeks was announced as the interval before the southern islands were to be occupied. MacArthur had fought a slow, cautious, methodical war, taking no chances with his postwar target, the presidency. His peacemaking was its twin, with censorship prolonged after victory long after the slightest pretext for it existed.<br><br>After submitting to the censors of the MacArthur command ever since I had escaped from Java in March, 1942, I felt I could not take much more. I remembered how his censors, perhaps eager not to offend or alarm the White House, killed a dispatch I wrote criticizing Roosevelt's defeat by Stalin at Yalta. With security no longer in question, I was not going to be stifled again. But I was not unaware that in planning to slip into an atomic city first, I was also risking repudiation by the conformists in my own profession. Four years earlier they had ceased bucking the communiqu�-fed hamburger grinder, and they disliked-while perhaps secretly admiring-anybody who kept on trying to report the war, to make the public think as well as feel.<br><br>My plan of extrusion formed itself a few hours after we all sat on the gun turrets of the Missouri, watching Japan surrender to MacArthur and Nimitz. This measured rite over-almost wrecked by a Russian photographer in Lenin cap who was chased around like Harpo Marx-the correspondents were summoned ashore to a press conference. The war was ended, as we had reported, but the censorship was not. There was no chance, therefore, to ask from Tokyo why the Kurile Islands, regular patrol grounds of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, were to be handed to Russia. What the command wanted covered was the prison camps of northern Japan. The dam was to be opened to one last orgy of home town stories, more mindless and more alike than the slow molasses drippings of four years of sloppy, apolitical, dear-mom war. Everything had been arranged: destroyers and planes were to take the correspondents north. North, north, north, away from where the war had been decided a month before.<br><br>Once, in midwar, I had been able to escape the darkrooms of the four main theaters of war by going home and running off a book called Bases Overseas, claiming for the United States a worldwide network of small strong points where her men had died and her treasure been expended. I did not feel that the right way to end this war was to be herded north, away from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to chew more fodder about what-beasts-the-Japs-are and Jimmy-looks-skinnier-today. Only a few days before, but after the Mikado's surrender, a Saturday Evening Post writer who wore colonel's leaves refused to pass my story about the 503rd Paratroops on Corregidor, my old outfit, that revealed there were still Japanese bodies unburied in the tunnels. "That's contrary to the Geneva Convention, and might make the Japs cancel their surrender," he said. . . . The American psychological grasp of the Japanese was shallow.<br><br>I listened as the chief conducting officer, rod in hand, pointed out on a map the prison camps where the newsmen were to be allowed to land and play savior. "Southern Japan remains closed. However, there is a little place down here"-he pointed to the southern end of Kyushu-"where their navy had a kamikaze base. Anybody interested in the divine wind?"<br><br>"Geisha schools next door?" asked a jaded voice.<br><br>"Nuh-uh. And the pilots are all in the stockade, I'm afraid." Ah, no interviews, then. Enemy personnel, minimize glorification of.<br><br>"What happened to their planes?" asked a hopeful photographer.<br><br>"Not much left after the flyboys worked 'em over. But we do have the strip working again. That's a story in itself." Nobody seemed to agree. For Stripes, perhaps. SUICIDE STRIP OPERATIVE-ENGINEERS IN OVERNIGHT MIRACLE. Full of bewildering unit numbers, and ten terse words from the colonel.<br><br>No hand was raised for the kamikaze junkpile. Everybody signed for a prison camp, or nothing, and walked out. At the door I turned back to have another look at the map. The kamikaze hole was named Kanoya. While the officer was sorting out his camps and correspondents, I cased Kanoya. A railroad came down to it. Kyushu, in fact, was covered with little railroads. But were any operating?<br><br>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were a long way north, and it was partly mountain country, where bridges had been knocked out.<br><br>And then I felt rising in me, like a warm geyser, a jet of confidence. It is like the moment when a poem unties your mind.<br><br>"I might kill a couple of days with that Kanoya thing," I said. "Who's conducting?" He told me the name of a captain, new to me, not one of MacArthur's little foxes I had been dodging since Buna and Moresby.<br><br>"Okay, I'll take a chance."<br><br>"Sign here."<br><br>The conducting officer, when I met him later, turned out to be a young, friendly captain who had earned a late overseas assignment by impeccable performance somewhere back home. He had already dutifully pulled together everything about Kanoya that could be wrung out of intelligence. Next morning, as we got aboard the plane, I asked him: "What made the general take Kanoya and leave out all the rest of southern Japan?"<br><br>He knew, because he had asked. "He had to give back to Eisenhower and Marshall all the C-54s he borrowed to bring our headquarters in from Manila. So we're down mostly to C-47s. They need fuel between Atsugi and Okinawa."<br><br>I wanted to get some idea how hard this eager officer was going to press me to produce. "No pain for you, I hope, if I don't find a story in traffic safety," I said.<br><br>"It's a gamble," he said cheerfully. "No pain, no strain."<br><br>Neither of us mentioned the conspicuous nearness, ...</p><h2>My Mother&#39;s Daughter: A Memoir</h2><p>Personal memories of the sort her <i>Chatelaine</i> readers adored &#x2014; a remarkable life story seen through the window of her relationship with her mother.<br><br>Every woman&#x2019;s relationship with her mother is special. Yet everyone will recognize some parts of another woman&#x2019;s story, especially if it is told as honestly and as sensitively as Rona Maynard tells it here.<br><br>As a little girl, Maynard soon came to see that her family was not an ordinary one. Her father, Max, was an artist and an alcoholic. Her mother was Fredelle Maynard, a brilliant academic who could not get a teaching job because she was a woman. Instead she became a writer &#x2014; the author of <b>Raisins and Almonds</b> &#x2014; and, above all, a driving, loving, ambitious, overpowering mother.<br><br>In her shadow (and that of younger sister Joyce, who went off at eighteen to live with J.D. Salinger) Rona took time to blossom as a writer and editor in Toronto. This book takes us through her career, step by step, including the miseries of being accused by her son&#x2019;s teachers &#x2014; and her own mother &#x2014; of being a bad mother, overly concerned with her own career.<br><br>Rona&#x2019;s strong, direct style will ring true for every working woman. Through the magic of her writing, she gives a clear-eyed and affectionate account of her relationship with a demanding, loving mother.<br><i>I said to my father, "You don&#x2019;t live here any more. This is Mother&#x2019;s house, not yours. It&#x2019;s time for you to go."<br>My father cursed me. He shook his fist. Then he left and never came back.<br></i>&#x2014;From <b>My Mother&#x2019;s Daughter</b></p><p>Born in New Hampshire of Canadian parents, Rona Maynard went to the University of Toronto, where she met and married Paul Jones. A career in journalism, including a spell at <i>Maclean</i>&#x2019;s, led in time to her becoming editor of <i>Chatelaine</i> in 1995, where she attracted a new generation of readers to the most enduringly successful magazine in Canada. A freelance writer since she left <i>Chatelaine</i> in 2004, she is also a professional lecturer who is much in demand. She lives in Toronto.Around five o&#x2019;clock on a Sunday afternoon, as I lounged on my bed with <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, someone&#x2019;s car blasted out of our driveway like a hot rod. I rushed to the window just in time to see our blue Studebaker tear down the street, my mother at the wheel. Bound for points unknown, an hour before dinner.<br><br>In the kitchen she&#x2019;d left a ghost meal. A mound of peeled apples, turning brown. A pastry blender clogged with shortening. The <i>Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook</i> spread-eagled in a puddle of tomato pulp. That night, for the first and only time, dinner consisted of sandwiches. My father cleared his throat. My sister spilled her milk. No one spoke.<br><br>The queen of England might as well have run off to an island with a pirate; that&#x2019;s how baffled I was.<br><br>Next morning I found my mother in the kitchen, the pressure cooker already seething. Chicken soup, Daddy&#x2019;s favourite lunch. &#x201c;So where were you last night?&#x201d;<br><br>The answer exploded as if she&#x2019;d been waiting to let fly. &#x201c;Out, that&#x2019;s where! Has it ever occurred to you, Rona, that I might deserve at least a small reward for the work I do around here? That maybe after stocking the cookie jar and entertaining Daddy&#x2019;s students and cranking out another three thousand words for <i>Good Housekeeping</i>, I might want a few minutes to call my own? You of all people should understand that, Miss Can&#x2019;t You See I&#x2019;m Reading, Miss Don&#x2019;t Come in Without Knocking! For a bright girl you can be surprisingly obtuse. You seem to have forgotten that I spent the best part of the weekend helping you finish that dress you had to wear today, never mind that I&#x2019;ve got a deadline to meet. And what did you say to me afterwards? Waving your dainty hand as if I were your maid? &#x2018;We&#x2019;re out of Diet Pepsi.&#x2019; Would it kill you to drink something else?&#x201d;<br><br>So her anger was all my fault. Oh please! She was the one who scorned store-brought cookies, who prodded me to make my own dresses, who faithfully sent all her magazine tearsheets to Grandma. By this time she made more money writing for women&#x2019;s magazines than my father did teaching literature. (She must have been the only writer in <i>Good Housekeeping</i>&#x2019;s stable who crafted her prose with Milton&#x2019;s cadences ringing in her brain.) If my mother thought she had too much to do, let her try doing less. Holden Caulfield had a word for people like her: phony! (She would have called him the hero of a book, <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>; I thought of Holden as the boy I loved.) That day I got my Diet Pepsi, a whole case of it. But if she wanted me to thank her, she&#x2019;d be waiting until her precious teak table was ready for a yard sale.<br><br>It was 1964, a year of anthems and polemics. Marchers denouncing the Vietnam war, three civil rights workers killed in Mississippi. I linked arms with a cluster of demonstrators in a town with no black people, singing &#x201c;We Shall Overcome&#x201d; and wondering when some dashing, blue-jeaned saviour of the downtrodden would be smitten with my inner beauty. I was almost fifteen; my mother was forty-two. She had just acquired a paperback copy of <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>, which she carried around like a talisman, filling the margins with notes in her emphatic hand. She kept leaving that book on the kitchen table or the back of the toilet, as if she were daring me to read it. But I had read the article in <i>Life</i> magazine, and it told me more than enough about the plague of boredom dogging housewives all over the land. Like a witch with a frowzy bubble cut, author Betty Friedan had foretold my mother&#x2019;s flight from her kitchen: &#x201c;Sometimes...the feeling gets so strong [a woman] runs out of the house...&#x201d; If this was revolution, I didn&#x2019;t want it. Besides, I&#x2019;d never be one of those women, those pitiful, tranquilized chumps fuming over their vacuum cleaners. I&#x2019;d write poetry under the eaves in a Greenwich Village flat, by the light of a candle in a Chianti bottle. No wage-slave husband for me. I&#x2019;d have a lover who spoke like Richard Burton, looked like Jean-Louis Trintignant and rattled the walls of Middle America like Bob Dylan.<br><br>A sign on my bedroom door shouted, &#x201c;PROTEST AGAINST THE RISING TIDE OF CONFORMITY.&#x201d; The sign had a target: my mother, with her dutiful cocktail parties for Daddy&#x2019;s loudmouth colleagues, who would never recommend him for promotion, no matter how elaborate her canap�s. My mother, who prided herself on driving miles out of her way to save a few cents on canned cream-of-mushroom soup, burning up the savings on gas. My mother, who invented and overcame a new crisis every month &#x2014; drug addiction, widow-hood, agoraphobia &#x2014; for a magazine feature called &#x201c;My Problem and How I Solved It&#x201d; (with no byline, she could take on a multitude of sad-sack personas). <i>Why don&#x2019;t you solve a real problem, Mother? How about &#x201c;My Husband Is a Drunk&#x201d;?</i><br><br>Of course, I never said that. What I said, rolling my eyes in case she didn&#x2019;t get the point, was, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to get out of this place!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your problem isn&#x2019;t this house, Rona. It&#x2019;s you. When you&#x2019;re old enough to read <i>Paradise Lost</i>, you&#x2019;re going to look back on these years and understand that Satan is your soulmate:<br><br>Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell;<br>And in the lowest deep a lower deep<br>Still threatening to devour me opens wide,<br>To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>Why couldn&#x2019;t she just tell me to go to hell, the way other parents did when their kids drove them wild? She had to prove she was above such lowbrow tactics, that&#x2019;s why. My mother was an expert on <i>Paradise Lost</i>, along with everything else John Milton wrote. Other people had forgotten that, so I was supposed to remember. But I knew the score. &#x201c;You have no idea what&#x2019;s going on in my head!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know me at all. But I&#x2019;ll give you credit for one thing. You made me strong enough to fight you!&#x201d;</p><h2>The Complete Cabinetmaker&#39;s Reference</h2><p><p><b>The One Book Every Cabinetmaker Needs to Own</b></p><p>Build any cabinet imaginable, in any size, and with lightning speed.

Since these are interrelated, if one fails, they will all explode into an "economic time bomb." Browne's answer to this uncertainty is a "permanent portfolio," aimed at withstanding and making money in any economic climate; it includes 25 percent common stocks, 25 percent gold, 25 percent cash-like investments (such as T-bills), and 25 percent treasury bonds. For those wanting to speculate or play hunches, Browne recommends a parallel "variable portfolio," made up of money that investors can afford to lose. A valuable source for the investing public. Despite its title, Meek's book has nothing to do with the October 1987 stock market crash. His purpose is to help average people manage their finances. He touches on estates and trusts, the importance of disability and life insurance, and how to choose and use a financial consultant, in conjunction with an attorney and a CPA. Common stocks, either owned individually or through mutual funds, are Meek's preferred vehicle of investing. Their long-term success is undeniable, and Meek has some jargon-free and well-written advice on buying them. Unfortunately, he sometimes gets bogged down with too many graphs when explaining his system, which is based on monetary formulas and business cycles. Still, his skeptical eye and understanding of the importance of crowd psychology will not disappoint investors looking for guidance.<br><i>- Alex Wenner, Indiana Univ. Libs., Bloomington</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Noted investment guru Browne offers cogent and practical advice on how investors can shield their capital in turbulent economic times. As an added plus, readers are treated to a clear-sighted and direct analysis of the economic issues confronting the U.S. today. Browne convincingly argues that the trade deficit, the stock market crash and America's new status as a debtor nation are all, in reality, "non-problems." Normal economic forces will simply, and nearly painlessly, correct these "imbalances" without the need for hasty and ill-considered government interference, Browne maintains. In fact, he opines, government interference may well detonate the economic time bombs he discusses. Despite his title, Browne does not predict economic catastrophe, but warns that the conditions for one exist. To protect an investor's capital, he has devised a diversified "Permanent Portfolio," counseling investments in gold, bonds and stocks which, in his view, should preserve an investor's capital in any economic climate.

An extraordinary montage that resurrects a forgotten and tragic era.<br><br></p><p><br>Alexander Stille is the author of <i>Excellent Cadavers: The Mafia and the Death of the First Italian Republic and Benevolence </i>and <i>Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families Under Fascism</i>. He is a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and lives in New York City.<br><br>The complex experience of Italy's Jews under fascism is personified in the experiences of five families whose socioeconomic and geographic background and response to fascism varied, but who all were overtaken by the tragedy of the Italian holocaust. From fervent belief in fascism, through courageous resistance to the horrors of Buchenwald and back, the story is told in the words of the families themselves, interwoven with the author's clear and dispassionate historical narrative. This book is thoroughly researched and documented, but it is the distinctive and surprisingly calm voices of the families that provide a harrowing and deeply moving oral history. A worthy companion to such classics of the Italian holocaust as Giorgio Bassani's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (HBJ, 1983) and Primo Levi's The Periodic Table ( LJ 1/85), this should be in all libraries with collections in European history or Jewish studies.

Whereas fierce public debates once centered on provocative work by upstart artists, the scrutiny has now expanded to mainstream cultural institutions and the ideas they present. In <b>Displays of Power</b>, Steven Dubin, whose <i>Arresting Images</i> was deemed "masterly" by the <i>New York Times</i>, examines the most controversial exhibitions of the 1990s. These include shows about ethnicity, slavery, Freud, the Old West, and the dropping of the atomic bomb by the Enola Gay. This new edition also includes a preface by the author detailing the recent Sensation! controversy at the Brooklyn Museum. <b>Displays of Power</b> draws directly upon interviews with many key combatants: museum administrators, community activists, curators, and scholars. It authoritatively analyzes these episodes of America struggling to redefine itself in the late 20th century.</p></p><p><b>Steven C. Dubin's</b> most recent book, <i>Arresting Images</i>, was named a New York Times Notable Book of the Year (1992). He is the Director of the Media, Society, and the Arts Program at the State University of New York, Purchase."Reveals how demands for accountability to various interest groups frequently lead to censorship [and] a retreat from shows that deal with complex social questions." (<i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>"Displays of Power is contentious, irreverent, and entertaining, but it is also absolutely serious. ... Is the book useful or intimidating? Is it a cautionary tale or a diatribe against museum complacency? I believe that it is all of these things. ... A cautionary tale told boisterously and wittily." (<i>Museum News</i>)<br><br>"A lively and insightful new book. ... Using an evenhanded journalistic approach and remarkably revealing interviews, Dubin documents how the institutions, run by idealistic and politically naive curators and exploited by conservative opponents, were marred by allowing minor conflicts to blow up into front-page stories. ... Show[s] that while museum may be adept at producing spectacular displays of propaganda, they are often incapable of predicting the reactions of their audiences." (<i>Artforum</i>)<br><br>"A signal contribution to the 'culture wars,' Dubin dispassionately examines the contemporary American museum as a battleground for the control of expression where elitist and populist camps clash over politically sensitive art. ... His provocative study gives voice to curators and partisans on all points of the spectrum, making his book something of a lively free-for-all. ... Cogently demonstrates that modern museums are crucibles for change rather than pleasant refuges, and that they are expanding the public's awareness that we live in an increasingly multicultural society and a multinational world." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p><h2>The Last of the Tribe: The Epic Quest to Save a Lone Man in the Amazon</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, the Amazon has yielded many of its secrets, but it still holds a few great mysteries. In 1996 experts got their first glimpse of one: a lone Indian, a tribe of one, hidden in the forests of southwestern Brazil. Previously uncontacted tribes are extremely rare, but a one-man tribe was unprecedented. And like all of the isolated tribes in the Amazonian frontier, he was in danger. <br><br>Resentment of Indians can run high among settlers, and the consequences can be fatal. The discovery of the Indian prevented local ranchers from seizing his land, and led a small group of men who believed that he was the last of a murdered tribe to dedicate themselves to protecting him. These men worked for the government, overseeing indigenous interests in an odd job that was part Indiana Jones, part social worker, and were among the most experienced adventurers in the Amazon. They were a motley crew that included a rebel who spent more than a decade living with a tribe, a young man who left home to work in the forest at age fourteen, and an old-school <i>sertanista </i>with a collection of tall tales amassed over five decades of jungle exploration. <br><br>Their quest would prove far more difficult than any of them could imagine. Over the course of a decade, the struggle to save the Indian and his land would pit them against businessmen, politicians, and even the Indian himself, a man resolved to keep the outside world at bay at any cost. It would take them into the furthest reaches of the forest and to the halls of Brazil&#x2019;s Congress, threatening their jobs and even their lives. Ensuring the future of the Indian and his land would lead straight to the heart of the conflict over the Amazon itself. <br><br>A heart-pounding modern-day adventure set in one of the world&#x2019;s last truly wild places, <i>The Last of the Tribe </i>is a riveting, brilliantly told tale of encountering the unknown and the unfathomable, and the value of preserving it.</p><p>Monte Reel lives in Buenos Aires with his wife and daughter. He was the South America correspondent for <i>The Washington Post</i> from 2004-2008 and previously wrote for the paper in Washington and Iraq.&nbsp;<b><b>CHAPTER ONE<br>The Hut</b></b><br> <br>It began with a rumor, a scrap of conversation picked up by a health worker delivering antimalarial medicine in the scattered villages of southern Amazonia. In the middle of 1996, he stopped at a lumberyard in Brazil&#x2019;s Guapor� River Valley, near the Bolivian border. Loggers there spoke of a wild man who roamed the surrounding rain forest, which they occasionally ventured into in search of mahogany trees. The man was a naked savage, they said, probably an Indian. But he didn&#x2019;t appear to be part of any tribe. From what they could see, he lived all alone in a tiny thatched hut, with no apparent ties to another human soul.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s where their story dead-ended. The few who claimed to have caught a blurred glimpse of the man said he was as quick and crafty as a jaguar&#x2014;get near him, and he&#x2019;d vanish into the forest&#x2019;s dappled shadows. Describing encounters with him apparently was like trying to remember an elusive dream: they were pretty sure it happened, but they couldn&#x2019;t quite grasp the details.<br> <br>It was a flimsy splinter of jungle lore, but it stuck with the health worker when he left the lumberyard and eventually made his way to the town of Vilhena, where Brazil&#x2019;s federal agency in charge of Indian affairs maintained a regional outpost. He previously had met the man who ran that office, Marcelo dos Santos, while delivering medicines to one of the region&#x2019;s indigenous reserves.<br> <br>If anyone could dismiss the rumor outright and label it a tall tale unworthy of a second thought, it was Marcelo. His job was to locate Indian tribes that remained isolated in the forest, completely cut off from the main current of Brazilian society. His small team of field agents was called the Guapor� Contact Front, one of five regional exploratory teams within the Isolated Indians Division of Brazil&#x2019;s National Indian Foundation, known as FUNAI. The Isolated Indians Division was less than a decade old, created just before the country ratified a new constitution in 1988. The new national charter specified that if Indians lived on a patch of rain forest, that land was theirs&#x2014;not a single tree could be touched by an outsider. But a fundamental shortcoming threatened to completely undermine the document&#x2019;s intentions: no one knew how many tribes actually lived in Brazil&#x2019;s massive portion of the Amazon, or how much land they potentially could claim. So if a rancher stumbled across a previously uncontacted tribe in a part of the forest that he wanted to clear for grazing, the rancher had a natural incentive to chase the Indians off the property before the government could document their presence. The contact fronts were created to defuse the threat of clashes between settlers and tribes.<br> <br>Marcelo was forty-two when he took the reins of the exploratory team in 1994, after twenty years as a field agent with FUNAI. One look at him and it was clear he didn&#x2019;t really fit in with the clean-cut farmers who dominated Vilhena&#x2019;s social circles. He cut his hair only when he felt like it, and he&#x2019;d kept the blond beard that he grew in college, letting it go wherever it wanted, untrimmed. From his left earlobe dangled a loop of carved bark, a handmade earring common among members of the Nambiquara tribe he&#x2019;d lived among for more than a decade. Give him a choice, and he just might walk down the street barefoot. Some of the farmers called him a hippie. A few turned the screws on the insult a little tighter: they called him a hippie who wanted to be an Indian. They weren&#x2019;t entirely wrong.<br> <br>Marcelo&#x2019;s right-hand man was Altair Algayer, a twenty-three-year-old who had worked for Marcelo&#x2019;s predecessor. Altair had spent much of his life in or around the state of Rond�nia&#x2019;s forests. He had a fourth-grade education and a mind like a thirsty sponge. If the truck broke down, Altair could fix it. If the team needed to build a permanent jungle encampment complete with shower and latrine, Altair could sketch the plans and build it. If they needed to be fed, he could track, shoot, and butcher a wild boar. He was lanky and lean, but as strong and durable as a packmule. Marcelo rarely went on an expedition without him.<br> <br>Less than a year before, in September 1995, Marcelo and Altair had encountered two small Indian tribes that had never before been contacted peacefully by outsiders. The discoveries were hailed in the international press as the first of their kind in more than a decade in Brazil. For the Brazilian government, the experience had underscored the value of the contact fronts, and FUNAI was working to legally declare the newly demarcated territories as a single indigenous reserve. For Marcelo and Altair, the experience proved that the jungle, nearly five hundred years after outsiders began exploring its depths, was still capable of hiding mysteries.<br> <br>So when the health worker arrived in Vilhena with the rumor about the spectral wild man believed to be an Indian, Marcelo paid close attention. The health worker passed along the name of a man at the lumberyard who might be able to tell him more.<br> <br>Marcelo and Altair decided to pay him a visit. All they had to lose was a day or two, enough time to drive there and back.<br> <br>Marcelo sat behind the wheel, steering the battered Toyota four-by-four across miles of dirt roads that were furrowed with wheel-deep ruts. Altair jostled beside him on the truck&#x2019;s unforgiving bench seat. The sun burned hot, and the wind rushing through the opened windows brought little relief, just dust and the throaty roar of the truck&#x2019;s engine. The noise was enough to turn a conversation into an exhausting shouting match, which is why they always traveled with a box full of cassette tapes, and the stereo cranked up loud.<br> <br>The opening chords that blared from the dashboard speakers would have been instantly recognizable to almost any Brazilian: Jorge Ben&#x2019;s &#x201c;Pa�s Tropical.&#x201d; The title of the song means &#x201c;Tropical Country&#x201d; in Portuguese, and it was something like an unofficial national anthem for many Brazilians, especially those of Marcelo&#x2019;s generation who&#x2019;d gotten hooked on a back-to-the-land credo that flowered in the late 1960s. Marcelo shouted &#x201c;Jorge!&#x201d; as if calling out to an old friend:<br> <br><i>I live in a tropical country,</i><br> <br><i>Blessed by God and beautiful by nature.</i><br> <br><i>(But oh, what beauty!)</i><br> <br>Nature had been uncommonly generous in this riverine corner of Brazil, painting the landscapes according to a maximalist aesthetic that placed little value on restraint. This was nature in the extreme, laid on thick, without apology. The flora was irrepressible, accommodated by a rain forest that had enough room for just about anything&#x2014;giant hardwood trees, ropy lianas, trembling ferns, fluorescent lichens, heavy fruits on bending limbs. The animals provided an equally gaudy display, if you had a keen enough eye to spot them behind a thousand shades of green: ocelots, toucans, tapirs, sloths, monkeys, peccaries, armadillos, caiman, and untold legions of insects that filled the forest with the hum of life. Scientists and environmental activists liked to say that between one third and one half of the world&#x2019;s total species&#x2014;plant, animal, and microbe&#x2014;could be found in the Amazon rain forest, but that was just a guess, because it was impossible to catalog them all. But even if the claim couldn&#x2019;t be proved, the spirit behind it rang true: there was a profusion of vitality in this region, and it was more than enough to overwhelm the most ambitious taxonomist.<br> <br>Not everyone considered that a good thing. This part of Amazonia long ago had earned itself the nickname &#x201c;the Green Hell&#x201d; by those who likened it to a miasmal sump that didn&#x2019;t <i>brim</i> with life so much as <i>fester</i> with it. In the rain forest, the unremitting cycles of life and death are so tangled together that their differences quickly blur. By the time something dies, it has already started to become something else; the trunk of a dying tree is overtaken by fungi, and soon the tree becomes those fungi; the flesh of a peccary carcass instantly swarms with beetles, until beetles are all that&#x2019;s left. Individual distinctions grow nebulous, which can rattle the nerves of anyone who prefers a world defined by neatly ruled borders. The wilderness then becomes something that demands to be tamed and conquered, and civilization is separated from savagery.<br> <br>Marcelo and Altair rejected that view. When they sang along with Jorge Ben on the truck stereo, they were singing about the forest, a place that was neither paradise nor perdition, but one they penciled in closer to heaven than hell on their private maps of the world. This overgrown domain was their <i>pa�s tropical</i>.<br> <br>But some of the landscape they drove through on the way to the lumberyard didn&#x2019;t fit the lyrics of the song. It wasn&#x2019;t tropical, and it wasn&#x2019;t beautiful. It was dead.<br> <br>For miles on all sides, an ashen graveyard of charred stumps plotted the void where the forest recently stood. The land had been clear-cut with tractors and chains, then burned. The horizon was no longer obscured by treetops, but instead was washed out by a dirty white haze. Smoke was rising from live fires at the forest&#x2019;s sizzled edge, a frontier that crept a little farther from the road each day.<br> <br>Every so often the slender trunk of a denuded <i>acuri</i> palm, with its armor of fire-resistant bark, stood tall among the encrusted termite mounds that blistered the burned crust of the earth. Some of the fields were littered with disorderly piles of sawed trunks, ready to be stacked onto enormous flatbed trucks. Marcelo and Altair had been passing those trucks all day; they were the same ones that had chewed up the roads for dozens of miles in every direction.<br> <br>They regularly passed clusters of splintery gray shacks strewn along the roadside, fragile hovels that looked as if they&#x2019;d collapse into kindling with one swift kick. The shacks housed the peasant laborers employed by the cattle ranches that were multiplying with bacterial efficiency throughout the region. Rond�nia was still less than twenty years old, and in a single generation it had gone from a mostly unpopulated forest to the center of an agricultural explosion. As new roads began to fan throughout the region, this part of Amazonia was experiencing a rural migration that rivaled the conquest of the American West.<br> <br>Boomtowns were popping up all over: little bursts of activity that invariably announced their presence with a roadside beer joint consisting of little more than a corrugated roof, a few plastic chairs, and an old pool table. Marcelo and Altair drove past such a bar when they approached the town of Chupinguaia on the way to the mill. A year before, the town couldn&#x2019;t be found on any map; the state had declared it a new municipality just a few months prior. The locals called it a &#x201c;bang-bang town,&#x201d; one of several on the ragged fringe of Brazil&#x2019;s Wild West, and outsiders stopped at their own risk. Chupinguaia&#x2019;s population was anyone&#x2019;s guess&#x2014;probably at least a few hundred&#x2014;but it swelled on weekend nights, when the region&#x2019;s ranch hands hit the bars. Sunday mornings were a spectacle to behold. Walk through the barren central square just after dawn, and you literally had to step over dozens of bedless ranch hands spread-eagled in the dirt, exactly where they&#x2019;d passed out the night before. Everyone who called this place &#x201c;lawless&#x201d; was guilty of a slight imprecision of language: when Rond�nia was granted statehood in 1981, plenty of laws went on the books; it&#x2019;s just that the government lacked the resources to enforce them.<br> <br>That anything-goes atmosphere extended to the forest itself. Ranchers in the area had been known to fly over the trees in private planes spraying 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, the internationally banned defoliant in Agent Orange. Worse, empty plastic drums of the chemical had been scavenged by at least one of the local Indian tribes, which had been using the containers to store water, unaware that the small print on the barrels warned against reuse. Frontier justice being what it was, the deeds went unpunished.<br> <br>Marcelo and the other members of the Contact Front weren&#x2019;t cops, but when they witnessed illegal deforestation or other environmental crimes, they blew the whistle, calling federal prosecutors to complain. That didn&#x2019;t mean the police did anything about it. Hard evidence, such as earthmovers and chainsaws registered to a specific owner, could easily be moved before police were able to reach the areas in question. Outright denials of responsibility by landowners were so common that Marcelo had begun to invite Vincent Carelli, a former FUNAI agent with a passion for documentary film, to accompany the Contact Front on expeditions and document evidence with his video camera. Those whistle-blowing expeditions rankled a lot of ranchers and loggers. The Contact Front was quickly earning a reputation throughout Rond�nia as an obstacle to progress.<br> <br>Even before Marcelo and Altair decided to drive to the lumberyard to investigate the rumor of the lone Indian, some of the region&#x2019;s ranchers were publicly accusing the Contact Front of putting the interests of a few Indians above the overall economic health of the region. When the Contact Front had discovered those two isolated Indian tribes just months before, the ranchers who had already laid claim to those tribal lands banded together in defiance, hired a lawyer, and resolved to fight the government&#x2019;s demarcation of 193 square miles of land as an indigenous reserve, off-limits to development. Those ranchers had taken a clear stand. They had declared the Contact Front their enemy.<br> <br>On September 3, 1995, Marcelo and Altair had made first contact with an isolated group of Kanoe Indians. The tribe had been reduced to only five survivors.<br> <br>That peaceful encounter also had begun with a rumor. Before Marcelo and Altair had set out to find the Kanoe, Indian trackers believed that members of an isolated tribe lived in the area, but no one had seen them. Marcelo suspected that if a tribe was living there, its continued survival might be jeopardized by the chainsaws that were eating deeper into that tract of forest with each passing week.<br> <br>Marcelo and Altair&#x2014;with Vincent Carelli and his video camera following in their footsteps&#x2014;explored the forest near the banks of the Omer� River. Marcelo walked in front, following a slender trail worn through the thick undergrowth. The trail appeared to be a natural inlet through the forest used by wild boar and other animals, but there was more to it than that. Some of the branches and stems flanking the path had been snapped in places that stood more than four feet off the ground. Few animals native to this forest stood that tall. More than likely, it meant that other humans had walked that trail before them.<br> <br>For three days Marcelo&#x2019;s team had been hiking, crossing streams and following trails that led them deeper into the middle of nowhere. But on that third morning, they reached an area that had been partially burned. The ground had been reduced to soft white ash, and in the middle of that powdery residue they found the fresh imprints of bare human feet. The team twisted their shoulders out of their heavy backpacks and ventured deeper into the bush, carrying only the essentials. Altair propped a .22-guage Winchester rifle over his left shoulder. In his right hand he held a machete, which he waved in front of him in lazy arcs, clearing vines and branches to untangle the overgrown trail.<br> <br>They inched through the forest with a measured vigilance, because making first contact with a tribe that is unaccustomed to visitors is risky business. Throughout Brazil&#x2019;s history, stories of first contacts were too often chronicles of violence and mayhem.

American Classics features more than 300 recipes from favourite regional dishes such as Boston baked beans, New York Cheesecake, Chicago deepdish pizza and New Orleans&#39; legendary red beans and rice. There are chapters on soups and stews, salads, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish and shellfish, breads, sandwiches, breakfasts, cookies and brownies and puddings.</p><p>Derived from the pages of <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> magazine, <i>American Classics</i> (part of the successful Best Recipe series) offers 300 formulas for a soup-to-nuts trove of American standards--everything from clam chowder, mashed potatoes, and fried chicken to brownies, carrot cake, and lemon meringue pie (which required 28 tryouts before the "best" was achieved). The book goes far to realize its mission with exhaustive "what-we-were-looking-for-and-how-we-got-it" investigations; tons of useful asides on techniques, ingredients, and equipment; great how-to illustrations; and the recipes themselves, which are precisely thought through and clearly rendered. All in all, even a cursory dip into the book takes readers into the very heart of cooking.<p> How does it work? Let's take the recipe for Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, a simple dish but one that's frequently botched. First, the problem of achieving the right filling distribution: "Tradition ... suggests that the cheese be cut into thin, even slices for easy melting," say the authors, but this can be problematic as "cheese planes don't work well on soft, rubbery cheeses" and cutting with a knife "requires patience, practice, and a relatively hard block of cheese." After a number of slicing failures, the authors opt for "the common box grater ... which is quick and efficient." Next, the bread: "Some like it soft and some like it firm," but even so, a supermarket brand gets the nod. Testing a full range of fats reveals salted butter is best for "superior flavor and its ability to turn bread deeply golden," and so it goes through the choice of skillet (heavy gauge with a flat bottom) and the correct cooking temperature (no more than medium low). An exemplary recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches follows. </p><p> If all of this sounds obsessive, it is. More compelling is the fact that this approach helps readers understand the parameters of any cooking task, thus educating their tastes while also providing true technical empowerment. And the dishes really are keepers. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Founded in 1980, Cook&#39;s Illustrated has emerged as &#39;America&#39;s Test Kitchen&#39;, renowned for its near obsessive dedication to finding the best methods of home cooking.

Howard Pyle was born in 1853 and was well known as an illustrator, training men such as N.C. Wyeth. My wife and I wanted to reproduce some of his works to be enjoyed by a younger generation and have entirely re-typeset all the books we published as well as cleaned up some of the images to make them suitable for reprinting. This was a labor of love and we hope you enjoy reading the books as much as we did.<br><br>We have reprinted the four books about King Arthur and his knights as well as The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, all in a blue hardbound format.Howard Pyle was a successful American author and illustrator, many of whose books are aimed at younger readers. After only a few formal lessons in artistic techniques, Pyle initially began his career creating illustrations for magazines, finally publishing his first work in Harper s Weekly at the age of twenty-five. Pyle s career took off, and he was soon creating his own stories and publishing illustrated books for children. His most famous work is The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which was the first cohesive retelling of the medieval legend of Robin Hood. His other famous works include Men of Iron, a tale about knighthood, and a four-volume collection about King Arthur. Howard Pyle died in Florence in 1911 at the age of fifty-eight.</p><h2>Ghosts of Spain</h2><p>The appearance - sixty years after that war ended - of mass graves containing victims of Franco&#39;s death squads has finally broken what Spaniards call &#39;the pact of forgetting&#39;. At this charged moment, Giles Tremlett embarked on a journey around Spain - and through Spanish history. Tremlett&#39;s journey was also an attempt to make sense of his personal experience of the Spanish. Why do they dislike authority figures, but are cowed by a doctor&#39;s white coat? How had women embraced feminism without men noticing? What binds gypsies, jails and flamenco? Why do the Spanish go to plastic surgeons, donate their organs, visit brothels or take cocaine more than other Europeans?</p><p>Giles Tremlett is the Guardian&#39;s correspondent.

Tremlett, Madrid correspondent for the Guardian, went native almost immediately upon his arrival in Spain twenty years ago. He wants us to see, hear, touch, and taste exactly why. He will drag us from the beaches of the Costa Blanca, where bikinis saved Spain for northern European tourism, to theslums of Seville, where abused Gypsies and authentic flamenco are still to be found. We will follow im from the brothels of Valencia to the alcazars of Al Andalus to the serpent and axe of Bilbao and Basque terror to the latest statistics on child-rearing, golf courses, homosexuality, and cocaine consumption. We meet drug dealers, real estate hustlers, soccer stars, corrupt businessmen and pols, incorruptible judges, not-so-former Falangist, and Opus Dei. We speak Catalan in Barcelona, listen to the cantigas of trovadores Galicia, look at Picasso&#39; s Guernica in Madrid, watch Pedro Almodovar on TV in La Mancha, and learn that the novelist Camilo Jose Cela, winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize for Literature, once upon a time snitched on fellow writers to Franco&#39; s thugs. El Cid, Unamuno, Don Quixote, Garcia Lorca-- there are pages here on almost every exemplary, cautionary, and symbolic aspect of Old Spain and New except, perhaps, the Manolete Mausoleum in Cordoba; Tremlett doesn&#39; t much care for bullfighting. But mostly there are ghosts. And most of these ghosts belong to the Spanish Civil War and Franco&#39; s subsequent fascistic Brigadoon. In return for a bloodless transition to democracy after the dictator&#39; s death in 1975, all sides seem to have signed some unspoken agreement to subscribe to what Tremlett calls &#34; Amnistia and Amnesia&#34; -- a plague of forgetting right out of One Hundred Years of Solitude. But now the bodies buried in nameless dumps are turning up, literally, wherever ground is broken for a shopping mall. And nothing like South Africa&#39; s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has ever occurred to Spain, because nobody like Nelson Mandela has ever exerted an influence. Tremlett is excited, hopeful, worried. If we already know that, at our worst, we are capable of radical evil, can&#39; t we dream that our best might muster some radical good? Then, also waiting to be heard from, there are those other Spanish ghosts: the Moor and the Jew.&#34;-John Leonard, &#34;Harper&#39;s&#34;</p><h2>Energy Anatomy: The Science of Personal Power, Spirituality, and Health (With Study Guide)</h2><p>Describes the seven energy centers, or chakras, of the human body, how they relate to physical health, and the principles of intuitive diagnosis that lead to self-healing.</p><p>Borrowing chakra principles and healing teachings from previous works, Dr. Caroline Myss forms a daily living plan that focuses on making the most of personal energy.

Now Dr. Miller goes even further, presenting groundbreaking theories that enhance communication between therapist and patient and enable adults to express powerful emotions that have been trapped for years. Practical and perceptive, Miller&#x2019;s work explains what we can expect from therapy, how we can identify the causes of our own pain, and why subconscious pain, unaddressed for decades, manifests itself later as depression, self-mutilation, primal inadequacy, and chronic loneliness. Containing searing excerpts from &#x201c;The Diary of a Mother,&#x201d; in which a mother learns how to communicate honestly with both herself and her daughter, as well as a trove of Miller&#x2019;s own moving answers to her thousands of readers, <em>Free from Lies</em> is the culmination of a life devoted to healing others.</p><p>Alice Miller&nbsp;(1923-2010) is the author of such classic works as The Drama of the Gifted Child, Prisoners of Childhood, The Body Never Lies, From Rage to Courage, and Free from Lies.Free from Lies is a clarion call from one of the great psychological minds of our time. &#x2014; Stephen Kamsi, Saybrook Graduate School, San Francisco</p><h2>Hawaiki Rising: Hokule&#39;a, Nainoa Thompson, and the Hawaiian Renaissance</h2><p>Attuned to a world of natural signs &#x2013; the stars, the winds, the curl of ocean swells - Polynesian explorers navigated for thousands of miles without charts or instruments. They sailed against prevailing winds and currents aboard powerful double canoes to settle the vast Pacific Ocean. And they did this when Greek mariners still hugged the coast of an inland sea and Europe was populated by stone-age farmers. Yet by the turn of the twentieth century, this story had been lost and Polynesians had become an oppressed minority in their own land. Then, in 1975, a replica of an ancient Hawaiian canoe &#x2013; <i>H&#x14d;k&#x16b;le&#x2018;a</i> - was launched to once again sail the ancient star paths and help Hawaiians reclaim pride in the accomplishments of their ancestors. <i>Hawaiki Rising</i> tells this story in the words of the men and women who sailed aboard <i>H&#x14d;k&#x16b;le&#x2018;a.</i> They speak of growing up at a time when their Hawaiian culture was in danger of extinction and their future in their own land was uncertain. We join the founders of the Polynesian Voyaging Society as their vision of <i>H&#x14d;k&#x16b;le&#x2018;a</i> takes shape in a Honolulu shipyard. We sail on the first voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti in 1976;&nbsp; experience the heartbreaking loss of Eddie Aikau in a courageous effort to save his crewmates when <i>H&#x14d;k&#x16b;le&#x2018;a</i> capsized; and are present as new leaders vow to continue sailing to honor Eddie&#x2019; life. We are with Nainoa Thompson as he searches the heavens to rediscover ancient star signs and we sail with him as he guides <i>H&#x14d;k&#x16b;le&#x2018;a </i>to Tahiti &#x2013; the first Hawaiian to navigate the Pacific without charts or instruments in a thousand years. When Hokule&#x2019;a crew member Sam Ka&#x2018;ai carved the male <i>ki&#x2019;i</i> (sculpted figure) that adorns the canoe&#x2019;s starboard hull, he envisioned modern day Hawaiians in the figure of a blind man reaching to the heavens. &#x201c;This is an effigy of how we are after so many years of oppression,&#x201d; Sam tells us. &#x201c;Blind to our past, we reach up to grasp heaven one more time. The same stars are rising as they did for our fathers for many, many generations. So if you lose your way - remember that you once sailed on your mother&#x2019;s lap and you were never lost. The stars turned minute by minute, hour by hour, dawn and dusk and you always came home or your kind wouldn't be here. This is an effigy of the <i>H&#x14d;k&#x16b;le&#x2018;a</i> experience &#x2013; the <i>&#x2bb;ohana</i> <i>wa&#x2018;a</i> - the family of the canoe. He is reaching above himself, beyond himself, to the story that has not changed, the forever and ever story. He is showing that we are taking hold of the old story once again.&#x201d; <i>Hawaiki Rising</i> is the saga of an astonishing revival of indigenous culture by voyagers who took hold of the old story and sailed deep into their ancestral past.

Schlesinger's <i>Shadow Shoguns</i> is an arresting profile of an element of modern Japanese life little understood in the West: the relationship between economic superpowerdom and political corruption. In an astute and provocative piece of political reporting, Schlesinger, formerly of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s Tokyo bureau, paints a vivid portrait of state as corporation. This "Japan Inc." is a nation that has subverted democratic ideals to Capitalist opportunities, a country ruled by "shadow shoguns"--corrupt officials who have created a political machine for their personal profit. Schlesinger begins his tale with Kakuei Tanaka, a poor country boy who clawed his way through the construction business into politics and up through the ranks to become prime minister. This rags-to-riches story illustrates two points: the personal tenacity and ruthlessness of Tanaka and the fierce divisions between "Front" Japan--the glittering, urban economic miracle the country presents to the world--and "Back" Japan, the underdeveloped rural world from which Tanaka rose. <p> In many ways, the story of Tanaka is the story of modern Japan, a nation in which government corruption was tolerated in the interests of continuing economic growth. The past few years have seen both the bursting of Japan's economic bubble and the exposure of repeated government scandals. For anyone who has watched and wondered at the state of Japanese politics, Jacob M. Schlesinger's <i>Shadow Shoguns</i> offers a cogent explanation of how business, bureaucracy, and politics made such unholy bedfellows.</p>This is a vivid account of the corrupt and improbable political machine that ran Japanese politics for twenty years, from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, the period during which Japan became the world&#x2019;s second-largest economy.<br>Reviews<br>&#x201c;Washington lobbyists, Moscow mafiosi, and Beijing party bosses stand back! . . .

This collection, <i>The Short Stories,</i> originally published in 1938, is definitive. Among these forty-nine short stories are Hemingway's earliest efforts, written when he was a young foreign correspondent in Paris, and such masterpieces as "Hills Like White Elephants," "The Killers," "The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber," and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro." Set in the varied landscapes of Spain, Africa, and the American Midwest, this collection traces the development and maturation of Hemingway's distinct and revolutionary storytelling style -- from the plain, bald language of his first story, "Up in Michigan," to the seamless prose and spare, eloquent pathos of "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place" to the expansive solitude of the Big Two-Hearted River stories. These stories showcase the singular talent of a master, the most important American writer of the twentieth century.</p><p>The Short Stories, originally published in 1938, is definitive.

Tour.</p><p><p><b>Orson Scott Card</b>, a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author, has won several Hugo and Nebula awards for his works of speculative fiction. </p>Accomplished fantasy/SF writer Card ( The Memory of Earth ) has turned his autobiographical short story "Lost Boys" into an intriguing demi-mainstream novel. Here the Card family has been transmuted into the Fletchers, devout Mormons with three children and another on the way. A job offer from a South Carolina computer software company motivates Step Fletcher to move there; he is still seeking the financial success that once seemed assured via a computer game he invented. Unsettled by the move, their eldest son, Stevie, has trouble adjusting in school and becomes introverted, taking refuge with imaginary friends. Meanwhile, the Fletchers meet new people in their Mormon ward (including a religious hysteric), Step is the victim of malicious office politics and the family is beset by constant money troubles and worries about Stevie. Their concern escalates when young boys begin to disappear from the community, especially since the missing boys bear the names of Stevie's imaginary companions. Most of this absorbing novel has the pull of family drama with an over-layer of rising suspense, until Card switches genres and introduces half a dozen ghosts into the narrative. A cruel, if redemptive, experience for the Fletchers ensues. Though some readers may find the fantastic plot elements jarring, Card's easy and natural prose goes a long way toward authenticating the supernatural intrusion. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Do No Harm: A Novel</h2><p>When a British emergency room doctor saves the life a woman who apparently attempted suicide, he is accused of committing a crime and stands trial. Not only is Dr. Matthew Kemble&#39;s medical practice at risk, but also his liberty. If he is found guilty of trespassing on a woman&#39;s right to die, he could go to jail.The novel Do No Harm exposes the dangers faced by conscientious doctors in Britain. Dr. Kemble&#39;s decision to treat a patient in defiance of her Living Will pits him against English Law, public opinion and his own profession. The legal and personal battles he faces raise many questions about the role of the physician in the modern world, contemporary beliefs about autonomy and human rights, and the increasingly bitter clash of values in twenty-first century Britain.Set in and around London, the story explores the interrelated stories of a physician facing ruin and imprisonment at the height of his career, his old friend and doggedly determined lawyer, Jonathan Kirkpatrick, and Maria, a passionate, dedicated but intensely lonely young campaigner who while working for the defense proves incapable of staying out of trouble herself.</p><p><p><b>Fiorella De Maria&nbsp;</b>was born in Italy of Maltese parents.

Braudel skims over politics, wars, etc., in favor of examining life at the grass roots: food, drink, clothing, housing, town markets, money, credit, technology, the growth of towns and cities, and more. The history is fascinating and made even more interesting by period prints and drawings. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gravity Falls Don&#39;t Color This Book!: It&#39;s Cursed!</h2><p><p>The Pines twins find themselves on a prismatic adventure when Dipper gets trapped in a magical coloring book.

What's your trick to writing a series novel that can be enjoyed by a newcomer as well as a fan? </p> <p><strong>Charles Todd:</strong> We try to put ourselves in the readers&#x2019; shoes, so that he or she can start the series anywhere, and still feel right at home. That means concentrating on the current plot and setting, to make it as exciting as if it were the first time Bess ever tried to solve a mystery. That keeps the character fresh too, because our enthusiasm for Bess comes through. </p> <p><strong>DC: </strong> There is a wonderful subtext to the relationship between Bess, the WWI battlefield nurse, and Simon, her father's right-hand man in the military. What's really going on there?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> Simon and Bess haven&#x2019;t told us yet. There&#x2019;s most certainly chemistry there, a lot of it. Perhaps it hasn&#x2019;t dawned on them yet that there might be something more between them. Still, every once in a while, a twinge of jealousy crops up...</p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> The scenes of the British Army in India during the Colonial era (which form the background for the current story) are so colorful and fascinating, not the usual stuff of a mystery series. What inspired you to give Bess and her family a history in India?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> India made Bess such an intriguing character to work with. We didn&#x2019;t want her to be a staid Victorian. Instead she experiences Army life and understands duty. Her education includes a different, exotic culture. And the memory of the 1857 Indian Mutiny is always fresh, a constant reminder of danger. If you&#x2019;re going to write about a woman who can stand on her own two feet, there has to be an explanation of how she learned to be so independent. A traditional background wouldn&#x2019;t have worked.</p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> Will Bess ever meet up with Inspector Rutledge, the protagonist of your other mystery series?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> So far, we haven&#x2019;t come up with any good reason for letting them meet. But there is one character who is in both series&#x2014;Melinda Crawford. She&#x2019;s a cousin of Bess&#x2019;s family and has an Army background in India herself. She&#x2019;s also a close friend of Rutledge&#x2019;s family. Who knows if she&#x2019;ll ever introduce these two? And what will Simon have to say to <i>that</i>? </p><p><strong>DC:</strong> Bess is such a wonderful character, she feels so contemporary while still being true to her time. She has a real talent of drawing information out of others. What--or who--was your inspiration for Bess?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> The familiar Victorian woman, repressed and living under the thumb of her father and then her husband, is only one side of the picture. Intrepid Englishwomen traveled the world as missionaries or like Melinda Crawford, for adventure. Even the Suffragettes were ready to endure prison for their cause. The nurses who served in France, saving lives, were remarkable for their courage and devotion to duty. These are the real-life women who inspired Bess, women on the threshold of our time but still a very real part of their own.</p><p>World War I nurse and amateur sleuth Bess Crawford investigates an old murder that leaves her pondering a troubling question: How can facts lie?</p><p>In 1908, when a young Bess Crawford lived in India, an unforgettable incident darkened the otherwise happy time.

Assembled between 1972 and 1978, <i>The Cave</i> explores the philosophy of Wittgenstein, the nature of language, and the connections between the present and past. It constantly challenges the reader to question reality, time, and the poets themselves. The work ranges from complex and imagistic rambles through imaginary landscapes to terse, clear accounts of exploring Eldon&#x2019;s Cave in western Massachusetts, the setting of several of Coolidge&#x2019;s poems. Like a mystery novel, <i>The Cave</i> draws the reader in with hints that all the strands weave together into a coherent picture.</p><p>Clark Coolidge and Bernadette Mayer have been writing for over fifty years, and they have both had an unquantifiable impact on the direction of experimental poetry. In the words of Marcella Durand, who provides an introduction to <i>The Cave</i>, &#x201c;Coolidge and Mayer evidently shared a common mission in their writings to encompass consciousness, language, and the intricacy of physical/scientific/geologic structures, and to cross whatever fake borders had been set up between genres, materials, or even words themselves.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Clark Coolidge</b> lives in Petaluma, California. His most recent books include <i>Far Out West</i>, published by Adventures in Poetry, and <i>Bomb</i>, a collaboration with Keith Waldrop, published by Granary Books.</p><p><b>Bernadette Mayer</b> has experimented with numerous forms of media, including film, collage, stories, and poems. Her most recent books include <i>Scarlet Tanager</i> and <i>A Bernadette Mayer Reader</i>, both published by New Directions.</p></p><p>Coolidge and Mayer are arguably two of the most influential avant-garde poets of the 20th and now the 21st centuries, with work spanning the last fifty years of American letters. Bernadette Mayer was born in Brooklyn in 1945 and is the author of numerous books, including &#34;Two Haloed Mourners: Poems&#34; (Granary Books, 1998), &#34;Proper Name and Other Stories&#34; (1996), &#34;The Desires of Mothers to Please Others in Letters&#34;( 1994), and &#34;The Bernadette Mayer Reader&#34; (1992).

Lake Meadow Park lies a bit south of Chicago's Loop, a long sprint from Lake Michigan's shores. Even in heat like we'd had lately, the park would normally be crowded with people. Today it was deserted but for an old lady with a shopping cart and a long coat, tottering around the park. It wasn't yet noon, and my sweats and T-shirt were too hot for the weather.</p><p>I squinted around the park for a moment, took a couple of steps onto the grass, and got hit on the head by something damp and squishy.</p><p>I flinched and slapped at my hair. Something small fell past my face and onto the ground at my feet. A toad. Not a big one, as toads go<b> </b>it could easily have sat in the palm of my hand. It wobbled for a few moments upon hitting the ground, then let out a bleary croak and started hopping drunkenly away.</p><p>I looked around me and saw other toads on the ground. A lot of them. The sound of their croaking grew louder as I walked further into the park. Even as I watched, several more amphibians plopped out of the sky, as though the Almighty had dropped them down a laundry chute. Toads hopped around everywhere. They didn't carpet the ground, but you couldn't possibly miss them. Every moment or so, you would hear the thump of another one landing. Their croaking sounded vaguely like the speech-chatter of a crowded room.</p><p>``Weird, huh?'' said an eager voice. I looked up to see a short young man with broad shoulders and a confident walk coming toward me. Billy the Werewolf wore sweatpants and a plain dark T-shirt. A year or two ago the outfit would have concealed the forty or fifty extra pounds he'd been carrying. Now they concealed all the muscle he'd traded it in for. He stuck out his hand, smiling. ``What did I tell you, Harry?''</p><p>``Billy,'' I responded. He crunched down hard as I shook his hand. Or maybe he was just that much stronger. ``How's the werewolf biz?''</p><p>``Getting interesting,'' he said. ``We've run into a lot of odd things lately when we've been out patrolling. Like this.'' He gestured at the park. Another toad fell from the sky several feet away. ``That's why we called the wizard.''</p><p>Patrolling. Holy vigilantes, Batman. ``Any of the normals been here?''</p><p>``No, except for some meteorological guys from the university. They said that they were having tornadoes in Louisiana or something, that the storms must have thrown the toads here.''</p><p>I snorted. ``You'd think `it's magic' would be easier to swallow than that.''</p><p>Billy grinned. ``Don't worry. I'm sure someone will come along and declare it a hoax before long.''</p><p>``Uh-huh.'' I turned back to the Beetle and popped the hood to rummage in the forward storage compartment. I came out with a nylon backpack and dragged a couple of small cloth sacks out of it. I threw one to Billy. ``Grab a couple of toads and pitch them in there for me.''</p><p>He caught the bag and frowned. ``Why?''</p><p>``So I can make sure they're real.''</p><p>Billy lifted his eyebrows. ``You think they're not?''</p><p>I squinted at him. ``Look, Billy, just do it. I haven't slept, I can't remember the last time I ate a hot meal, and I've got a lot to do before tonight.''</p><p>``But why wouldn't they be real? They look real.''</p><p>I blew out a breath and tried to keep my temper. It had been short lately. ``They could look real and feel real, but it's possible that they're just constructs. Made out of the material of the Nevernever and animated by magic. I hope they are.''</p><p>``Why?''</p><p>``Because all that would mean is that some faerie got bored and played a trick. They do that sometimes.''</p><p>``Okay. But if they're real?''</p><p>``If they're real, then it means something is out of whack.''</p><p>``What kind of out of whack?''</p><p>``The serious kind. Holes in the fabric of reality.''</p><p>``And that would be bad?''</p><p>I eyed him. ``Yeah, Billy. That would be bad. It would mean something big was going down.''</p><p>``But what if<b> </b>''</p><p>My temper flared. ``I don't have the time or inclination to teach a class today. Shut the hell up.''</p><p>He lifted a hand in a pacifying gesture. ``Okay, man. Whatever.'' He fell into step beside me and started picking up toads as we walked across the park. ``So, uh, it's good to see you, Harry. Me and the gang were wondering if you wanted to come by this weekend, do some socializing.''</p><p>I scooped up a toad of my own and eyed him dubiously. ``Doing what?''</p><p>He grinned at me. ``Playing Arcanos, man. The campaign is getting really fun.''</p><p>Role-playing games. I made a monosyllabic sound. The old lady with the shopping cart wandered past us, the wheels of the cart squeaking and wobbling.</p><p>``Seriously, it's great,'' he insisted. ``We're storming the fortress of Lord Malocchio, except we have to do it in disguise in the dead of night, so that the Council of Truth won't know who the vigilantes who brought him down were. There's spells and demons and dragons and everything. Interested?''</p><p>``Sounds too much like work.''</p><p>Billy let out a snort. ``Harry, look, I know this whole vampire war thing has you jumpy. And grouchy. But you've been lurking in your basement way too much lately.''</p><p>``What vampire war?''</p><p>Billy rolled his eyes. ``Word gets around, Harry. I know that the Red Court of the vampires declared war on the wizards after you burned down Bianca's place last fall. I know that they've tried to kill you a couple of times since then. I even know that the wizards' White Council is coming to town sometime soon to figure out what to do.''</p><p>I glowered at him. ``What White Council?''</p><p>He sighed. ``It's not a good time for you to be turning into a hermit, Harry. I mean, look at you. When was the last time you shaved? Had a shower? A haircut? Got out to do your laundry?''</p><p>I lifted a hand and scratched at the wiry growth of beard on my face. ``I've been out. I've been out plenty of times.''</p><p>Billy snagged another toad. ``Like when?''</p><p>``I went to that football game with you and the Alphas.''</p><p>He snorted. ``Yeah. In January, Dresden. It's June.'' Billy glanced up at my face and frowned. ``People are worried about you. I mean, I know you've been working on some project or something. But this whole unwashed wild man look just isn't you.''</p><p>I stooped and grabbed a toad. ``You don't know what you're talking about.''</p><p>``I know better than you think,'' he said. ``It's about Susan, right? Something happened to her last fall. Something you're trying to undo. Maybe something the vampires did. That's why she left town.''</p><p>I closed my eyes and tried not to crush the toad in my hand. ``Drop the subject.''</p><p>Billy planted his feet and thrust his chin out at me. ``No, Harry. Dammit, you vanish from the face of the earth, you're hardly showing up at your office, won't answer your phone, don't often answer your door. We're your friends, and we're worried about you.''</p><p>``I'm fine,'' I said.</p><p>``You're a lousy liar. Word is that the Reds are bringing more muscle into town. That they're offering their groupies full vampirehood if one of them brings you down.''</p><p>``Hell's bells,'' I muttered. My head started to ache.</p><p>``It isn't a good time for you to be outside by yourself. Even during daylight.''</p><p>``I don't need a baby-sitter, Billy.''</p><p>``Harry, I know you better than most. I know you can do stuff that other people can't<b> </b>but that doesn't make you Superman. Everyone needs help sometimes.''</p><p>``Not me. Not now.'' I stuffed the toad into my sack and picked up another. ``I don't have time for it.''</p><p>``Oh, that reminds me.'' Billy drew a folded piece of paper out of the pocket of his sweats and read it. ``You've got an appointment with a client at three.''</p><p>I blinked at him. ``What?''</p><p>``I dropped by your office and checked your messages. A Ms. Sommerset was trying to reach you, so I called her and set up the appointment for you.''</p><p>I felt my temper rising again. ``You did what?''</p><p>His expression turned annoyed. ``I checked your mail, too. The landlord for the office dropped off your eviction notice. If you don't have him paid off in a week, he's booting you out.''</p><p>``What the hell gives you the right to go poking around in my office, Billy? Or calling my clients?''</p><p>He took a step in front of me, glaring. I had to focus on his nose to avoid the risk of looking at his eyes. ``Get off the high horse, Harry. I'm your freaking friend. You've been spending all your time hiding in your apartment. You should be happy I'm helping you save your business.''</p><p>``You're damned right it's my business,'' I spat. The shopping cart lady circled past in my peripheral vision, cart wheels squeaking as she walked behind me. ``Mine. As in none of yours.''</p><p>He thrust out his jaw. ``Fine. How about you just crawl back into your cave until they evict you from that, too?'' He spread his hands. ``Good God, man. I don't need to be a wizard to see when someone's in a downward spiral. You're hurting. You need help.''</p><p>I jabbed a finger into his chest. ``No, Billy. I don't need more help. I don't need to be baby-sitting a bunch of kids who think that because they've learned one trick they're ready to be the Lone Ranger with fangs and a tail. I don't need to be worrying about the vamps targeting the people around me when they can't get to me. I don't need to be second-guessing myself, wondering who else is going to get hurt because I dropped the ball.'' I reached down and snatched up a toad, jerking the cloth bag from Billy's hands on the way back up. ``I don't need you.''</p><p>Naturally, the hit went down right then.</p><p>It wasn't subtle, as attempted assassinations go. An engine roared and a black compact pickup truck jumped the curb into the park fifty yards away. It jounced and slewed to one side, tires digging up furrows in the sunbaked grass. A pair of men clung to a roll bar in the back of the truck. They were dressed all in black, complete with black sunglasses over black ski masks, and their guns matched<b> </b>automatic weapons in the mini-Uzi tradition.</p><p>``Get back!'' I shouted. With my right hand, I grabbed at Billy and shoved him behind me. With my left, I shook out the bracelet on my wrist, hung with a row of tiny, medieval-style shields. I lifted my left hand toward the truck and drew in my will, focusing it with the bracelet into a sudden, transparent, shimmering half-globe that spread out between me and the oncoming truck.</p><p>The truck ground to a halt. The two gunmen didn't wait for it to settle. With all the fire discipline of an action-movie extra, they pointed their guns more or less at me and emptied their clips in one roaring burst.</p><p>Sparks flew from the shield in front of me, and bullets whined and hissed in every direction as they ricocheted. My bracelet grew uncomfortably warm within a second or two, the energy of the shield taxing the focus to its limit. I tried to angle the shield to deflect the shots up into the air as much as possible. God only knew where all those bullets were going<b> </b>I just hoped that they wouldn't bounce through a nearby car or some other passerby.</p><p>The guns clicked empty. With jerky, unprofessional motions, both gunmen began to reload.</p><p>``Harry!'' Billy shouted.</p><p>``Not now!''</p><p>``But<b> </b>''</p><p>I lowered the shield and lifted my right hand<b> </b>the side that projects energy. The silver ring I wore on my index finger had been enchanted to save back a little kinetic energy whenever my arm moved. I hadn't used the ring in months, and it had a whale of a kick to it<b> </b>one I hardly dared to use on the gunmen. That much force could kill one of them, and that would be basically the same as letting them fill me full of bullets. It would just take a little longer to set in. The White Council did not take kindly to anyone violating the First Law of Magic: Thou Shalt Not Kill. I'd slipped it once on a technicality, but it wouldn't happen again.</p><p>I gritted my teeth, focused my shot just to one side of the gunmen, and triggered the ring. Raw force, unseen but tangible, lashed through the air and caught the first gunman with a glancing blow across his upper body. His automatic slammed against his chest, and the impact tore the sunglasses off his head and shredded bits of his clothes even as it flung him back and out of the pickup, to land somewhere on the ground on the other side.</p><p>The second gunman got less of the blast. What did hit him struck against his shoulder and head. He held on to his gun but lost the sunglasses, and they took the ski mask with them, revealing him to be a plain-looking boy who couldn't have been old enough to vote. He blinked against the sudden light and then resumed his fumbling reload.</p><p>``Kids,'' I snarled, lifting my shield again. ``They're sending kids after me. Hell's bells.''</p><p>And then something made the hairs on the back of my neck try to lift me off the ground. As the kid with the gun started shooting again, I glanced back over my shoulder.</p><p>The old lady with her shopping basket had stopped maybe fifteen feet behind me. I saw now that she wasn't as old as I had thought. I caught a flicker of cool, dark eyes beneath age makeup. Her hands were young and smooth. From the depths of the shopping basket she pulled out a sawed-off shotgun, and swung it toward me.</p><p>Bullets from the chattering automatic slammed against my shield, and it was all I could do to hold it in place. If I brought any magic to bear against the third attacker, I would lose my concentration and the shield with it<b> </b>and inexpert or not, the gunman on the truck was spraying around enough lead that sooner or later he wouldn't miss.</p><p>On the other hand, if the disguised assassin got a chance to fire that shotgun from five yards away, no one would bother taking me to the hospital. I'd go straight to the morgue.</p><p>Bullets hammered into my shield, and I couldn't do anything but watch the third attacker bring the shotgun to bear. I was screwed, and probably Billy was along with me.</p><p>Billy moved.

He saw the steaming cleaning solution sloshing around a rusting bucket near his right elbow and the quill-bristle brush in his left hand without having to move his head. He saw</i> chech'tluth <i>draining through the floor grates where First Officer HomQat had dropped his mug. He saw gnawed bones, greasy with fat, cast aside when the</i> gagh <i>had arrived. He also saw that much of the mess hall still required cleaning. So he crawled along the floor on his knees, dragging the bucket along with him, scrubbing the grates and the table legs and the backs of chairs. </i></p><p><i> Thick smells surrounded him, invigorated him. From the stench of engine lubricant to the overburdened waste processors and the sour sweat of too many bodies crushed in cramped quarters, he inhaled the essence of a warrior's life on a bird-of-prey. Only the deep woodflower tang of Sirella was more seductive than this! Soon he would be with her, presenting her an offering of power, of glory, of victory. For now, he would scrub. He scrubbed to the rhythm of a warrior's song, chanting the words as he worked. </i></p><p><i> He scrubbed until his scrub brush found smooth metal, glowing red in the half-light. He crouched low to the floor, eyeing his discovery: a</i> bat'leth, <i>forgotten amidst the kegs of flowing ale, the roasts, the</i> gagh, <i>the songs and stories. Martok ran a cautious finger over the tip, savoring the finely sharpened point. He jerked. A drop of blood drizzled down his finger. Throwing back his head, he laughed.</i> A noble weapon, to be certain! </p><p> <i>Gingerly, he lifted the blade off the floor, holding it on his forearms to admire the weight, the heft, the smooth perfection of each notch and curve. He flipped the weapon off his forearms, into his palms. Curling his fingers around the handle, he twirled it cautiously to the left and then the right, challenging his unseen combatant with a thrust-and-parry rhythm. He drew deep breaths, felt battle lust surge within him. Baring his teeth, he snarled, crafting a dance of spins and jabs.</i> To the throat! And the belly -- </p><p> <i>A dull thud and a clank told him his bucket had tipped. A hot gush flooded the deck, soaking his boots before he could sidestep the filthy fluid. </i></p><p><i> "Come now, Ketha boy," came the mocking voice, speaking in the hated tones of the privileged class. "Startled by a little water? You'll have to do better than that if you expect a promotion -- to scrubbing the plasma conduits!" A deep, throaty laugh reverberated through the galley. </i></p><p><i> Martok felt the eyes of the despised one fall on his</i> bat'leth. <i>Clutching the handle tightly, he imagined how he would gladly thrust the tip into his enemy's throat. Or not. Why grant him a swift, painless death when he could slowly eviscerate -- </i></p><p><i> "You are not worthy of such a weapon." </i></p><p><i> Turning around slowly, Martok saw -- as he expected -- the detestable grin: Kor. Growling, he lunged. </i></p><p><i> With an effortless twirl of his own blade, Kor deflected the blow, sending Martok's</i> bat'leth <i>clattering to the floor. He cackled, apparently amused by Martok's clumsiness.</i> </p><p> With my bare hands, then! <i>Martok thought, circling his foe. </i></p><p><i> "Fetch me some bloodwine, boy," Kor said, the edge of his</i> bat'leth <i>glinting in the torchlight. </i></p><p><i> "No." Martok willed the Dahar Master to meet his eyes.</i> I challenge you to look at me, old man. Afraid of what you'll see? </p><p> <i>Kor scarcely attempted to hide his disdain. "Make that ale, boy. Bloodwine cools a warrior's blood after he has tasted the fire of an honorable fight. But this..." He laughed. "...this was no fight. This was a jo -- " </i></p><p><i> Instantly, the</i> d'k tahg <i>slid out of Martok's sleeve, its extra blades deployed, and targeted on Kor's throat. </i></p><p><i> Kor tipped his head to one side and seemed to enjoy the breeze made by the blade whistling past his ear. Martok twisted around for another attack. But Kor pivoted behind him, slammed the back of Martok's knee with his boot, and wrested the knife out of his hand. Collapsing forward, Martok dropped onto all fours. </i></p><p><i> "Fool," Kor spat. "I knew of your strategy before you did. You will learn your place, mongrel!" He reached down and, with unexpected strength, pulled Martok to his feet by the scruff of his neck. </i></p><p><i> Martok resisted, twisting and jerking his body, struggling to break free.</i> How can he do this? An old man in his dotage holding his ground against a man in his prime? <i>Or was he? Martok's gaze dropped and, with horror, he saw his own withered, wizened body, his armor hanging off him like graveclothes. </i></p><p><i> And Kor? He tossed a great, glossy black mane, his clear eyes burning Martok with each glance. Kor released his grip; the general stumbled back a few steps, but remained standing. </i></p><p><i> Laughing with wild joy, Kor swept the blade up over his head, then around his back in a showy display of prowess. "For the insolence you've displayed, mongrel," he said, "the sentence is death, but I will not soil my noble weapon with your blood. A lesser one than I shall dispose of you!" The keen tip of the</i> bat'leth <i>spun down in a bright arc, finding purchase in the mess table and splitting it asunder. </i></p><p><i> The two halves teetered and crashed to the floor. Where the table had stood, the floor groaned, the deck plating peeled away like skin, and from the bowels of the ship, a dark vapor -- pierced only by a bright, flashing red light -- seeped through the floor. As the post ascended, Martok's heart chilled, for he knew whose hand Kor had designated to deal him death. He scanned the room for the Dahar Master, but the old man had already vanished, swallowed by the darkness. He threw himself on top of the post. If he could stop it, push it back to</i> Gre'thor, <i>from where it came...Grunting, he braced his hands on the light, pushing down with all his strength. Sweat beaded on his forehead and he bellowed mightily. </i></p><p><i> The post won. As it always did. </i></p><p><i> The force of the post's upward movement cast him aside like well-worn armor, throwing him hard. His teeth lacerated his tongue when his head slammed into something; he heard his bones crack. </i></p><p><i> There would be a battle. </i></p><p><i> Before the mists blinded him, he would find the</i> bat'leth <i>Kor had stripped from him. With a</i> bat'leth, <i>he stood a chance of defeating this challenger.... </i></p><p><i> Dropping to his knees, he felt his way over the floor with his hands, sifting through dirt, seeking the weapon. With a dull thud, he crawled headfirst into a metal barrier, and his world spun with bright dizziness. Up the paneling with his fingers, touching the rivets, feeling the divots and dents, then something warm. Something scaly and dry with a smooth, knife-sharp claw. He swallowed hard. The mists dissipated, unveiling a score of chanting Jem'Hadar, their reptilian eyes glinting in the half-dark. The Jem'Hadar whose hand he touched gave his forehead a solid shove, sending him sprawling onto the arena floor. </i></p><p><i> Small bits of gravel clung like barnacles to his sweat-slick face, but he lay still, prone on the floor, waiting for any indicators -- heat, respiration, shadows -- of Ikat'ika's location. Sensing his attacker's position by the sound of movement would be impossible: the Jem'Hadar was far too clever to let Martok find him so easily. His best chance of survival would be to reach the post. Where was the post? How could he have forgotten the post? Of all the rules he knew from his two years in Dominion Internment Camp 371, one had been ground into his bones: Never lose track of the post, whether your face has been ground into the gravel floor or your innards kicked into pulp. He had to touch the top of the post, make it stop blinking, or he would be disgraced, defeated. Maybe they would drag him back to his cell; maybe they would kill him outright. Martok didn't know; he didn't want to find out. He would not give the Jem'Hadar</i> petaQs <i>the satisfaction. </i></p><p><i> How long had he been fighting? He needed to stand. Again, he tried to push himself up, groaned, felt ribs shift under his skin and tasted blood in his mouth. Standing would not be possible, so the general crawled -- damn all Jem'Hadar -- and prayed to Kahless that he was moving toward the post! </i></p><p><i> Behind him, he heard sounds: light footfalls and low Jem'Hadar voices. Then, before him, he detected the crunch of a boot on gravel as Ikat'ika shifted his weight. He wanted Martok to know of his plan, wanted Martok to hesitate as he anticipated the blow to his already cracked ribs. The bone would puncture his lung and the pain would be paralyzing. Martok expected the tactic because he knew he would do the same, given the circumstances. But he would not grant Ikat'ika even a hint of victory by hesitating. Dragging himself on by his elbows, he pushed toward the post. </i></p><p><i> Martok pulled -- clawed -- his way up. With only seconds left, he slapped the domed top and the blinking ceased. Martok spun around with surprising speed to face his opponent,</i> d'k tahg <i>drawn.</i> Did I not lose this weapon at Kor's hand? <i>The thought startled him. </i></p><p><i> The split-second reflection offered Ikat'ika an opening. The Jem'Hadar feinted to his left, dipped his right knee, then spun around, the edge of his hand moving at incredible speed. Martok had no reply for his enemy; he was helpless to block the blow. The bones of his cheek shattered on impact, splinters thrusting up through the muscle. From out of the cacophony of the roaring crowd and shouts acclaiming Ikat'ika's triumph, Martok heard a noise that might have been a small piece of overripe fruit dropping from a branch and realized -- or remembered -- it was his eye. The world turned black, then purple, then red. He heard a noise he recognized as his own bellow of rage and pain and tried to focus beyond the pain, the shouting, the lights, and run at his opponent, but his legs</i> -- traitors! -- <i>would not obey him. </i></p><p><i> The general staggered, dropping his weapon. Not even shame could move him. Like the implosions of an ancient star, his perceptions had shrunk into an infinitesimally tiny mote of agony that had once been his eye. He cupped both hands over the socket, and primitive instinct tried to tell him that if he just held on he would save his eye, he would stop the slippery wet sliding down his cheek between his fingers. </i></p><p><i> But if he stood paralyzed, the fight would be over. Ikat'ika would win.</i> </p><p> He will not win, <i>Martok vowed.</i> As long as I have breath he will not win. <i>Pushing aside self-preservation, he dredged the surrounding dirt with his boot, feeling for the</i> d'k tahg. <i>Whether he faced Ikat'ika's direction or not, whether he could actually find his weapon or not, Martok would attack. Proudly, he would wear the honored scar -- this warrior's mark -- and he would wear it as a warning of defeat to any who dared challenge him. </i></p><p><i> Elbows bent and fists balled, he assumed a fighting stance. Nearly blind, he sought Ikat'ika -- </i></p><p><i> But found no one. No Ikat'ika, no Jem'Hadar, no Kor -- nothing except the damnable post, blinking steadily. He expected the low, grim laughter of a sated Jem'Hadar, but none greeted him. </i></p><p><i> Silence. </i></p><p><i> Swirling up from the floor, mists of darkness crawled over the barriers, into the arena seats, smothering each light they touched. Time. He was running out of time. He took a single step toward the post, seeking to claim victory before the last light snuffed out. He realized exhaustion had left him; the pain from his eye socket disappeared. He took another step. And another, each one coming faster than the last.</i> I will triumph, <i>he vowed. He reached the post, raised his arm -- </i></p><p><i> Slow, dull clapping broke the cavernous silence in the Great Hall, accompanied by echoing footsteps. </i></p><p><i> "Well done, General." Gowron emerged from behind a stone pillar and stood before him, wide eyes glittering with rage and madness. To Martok's eye, he was wreathed in shimmering silver as the metal links and decorations on the massive chancellor's cloak caught the flickering torchlight. The council chairs stood empty; they were alone, save for what ghosts of their ancestors had chosen to haunt this ancient place. </i></p><p><i> "Chan -- " He coughed. "Chance -- " His parched mouth refused to release the title. A fit of coughing overtook him, doubling him over.</i> </p><p> "Tika <i>cat bit off your tongue? Oh, wait." Gowron linked his arms across his chest, looking down his nose at Martok. "On second thought, that wouldn't be a</i> Tika <i>cat. Worf has your tongue. He does speak for you, does he not? You are his puppet." </i></p><p><i> "I speak for myself," Martok snarled. "I serve the empire!" </i></p><p><i> "Traitor," Gowron hissed, throwing a backhanded punch to Martok's face, followed quickly by a boot to the throat. </i></p><p><i> Martok reeled, his skull crashing into the post. He struggled for air. Had Gowron crushed his larynx? Would he die desperately wheezing for one more breath? Martok had seen more than one warrior -- Klingon and alien alike -- die that way, and it was not the ignominious end he had in mind for himself, his face first turning crimson, then black as he puffed and heaved. Salty thickness filled his mouth, gagging him; he spat out the clot, some fragments of teeth, and something soft and formless that must have been a piece of his tongue. </i></p><p><i> Using the post to pull himself off the floor, Martok twisted back around to find Gowron looming over him. Blood spraying from between his lips, the general roared, "I didn't send Worf to kill you, you stupid</i> petaQ! <i>He made that decision by himself!" </i></p><p><i> Speechless with rage, Gowron wiped flecks of blood from his face, then stepped back to set up another kick, but Martok was ready for him. When the foot came in, Martok wrapped himself around it, set his hands on either side of Gowron's knee, one above, one below, and twisted. There came a satisfying crunching noise and Gowron howled as he tumbled to the floor. Martok had lost track of his</i> d'k tahg, <i>but that didn't matter. There were many, many ways to kill a man with only one's bare hands and Martok knew them all. </i></p><p><i> The thought flashed through Martok's mind as he fell on Gowron that he must be quite a sight by now. Eye gone, mouth torn open -- not at all the way a general should present himself to his chancellor. Worf would not approve.... </i></p><p><i> Wait.... </i></p><p><i> Kor had died in battle against the Jem'Hadar. Worf hadn't tried to assassinate Gowron, but rather had challenged him to honorable combat and won, then made Martok chancellor. The "leader of destiny," Worf had called him. What kind of leader could Martok be now? One with half a tongue to speak and one eye to see? Martok laughed aloud at the thought and spat blood into the pile of dirt beneath him. </i></p><p><i> Pile of dirt? The thing that he had thought was Gowron was only a rill of ear...</i></p></p><h2>Fountain Pens: Vintage and Modern</h2><p>This authoritative and comprehensive reference book, tracing the development of the fountain pen from its beginnings in the 1880s to the present day, meets the needs of both the collector of fountain pens and the user of modern pens.

The triumph of James Harvey's book is its ability to convey the delights of the genre when it was at its best, during the 1930s and '40s. Though he devotes chapters to major filmmakers such as Frank Capra and Howard Hawks, and stars like Cary Grant, Claudette Colbert, Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers, Harvey's focus is on two of the finest directors of the period: Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. Harvey describes the joys of watching their movies as he offers many intriguing insights into their cinematic styles and comic techniques. One of the best things about this book is its author's willingness to discuss obscure, hard-to-find films. Of course, he covers popular entertainments such as Lubitsch's <i>Ninotchka</i>, Capra's <i>It Happened One Night</i>, and Sturges's <i>The Lady Eve</i>, but he also devotes equal time to little-known, fascinating works like Sturges's <i>The Great Moment</i> and Lubitsch's <i>Angel</i>. This is an invaluable companion for anyone interested in learning more about two of Hollywood's most wonderful auteurs or about romantic comedy in general. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i><b>James Harvey</b> is a playwright, essayist, critic, and author several books on the movies.

From Vietnam, French and US, to Afghanistan, Russian and US, to Israel and the Palestinians, to Somalia and Kosovo, recent history is replete with powerful military forces being tied up by seemingly weaker opponents. This is Fourth Generation War (4GW), and Colonel Thomas Hammes, United States Marine Corps, tells you all about it. The author explains asymetrical warfare (4GW) as the means by which Davids can defeat Goliaths.Answers to the &#34;hows&#34; of this along with recommendations for prescriptive actions are found in Thomas Hammes insightful book on the strengths and weaknesses of coventional military power. Hammes, a full colonel on active duty in the Marine Corps is an expert at asymetrical warfare, perhaps better known as fourth generation warfare (4GW). This is the means by which Davids can defeat Goliaths.Colonel Hammes is well placed to write this study.

Colonel Hammes is considered by many in the defense community as the foremost expert in insurgent warfare.

He lives with his family in northern Virginia.<p>Military Review, March/April 2007<br>&#x201c;Can a two-and-one-half-year-old book be reviewed as a classic? It can, and should, if it says the kinds of smart, prescient things that Hammes had to say in 2004.&nbsp;The Sling and the Stone was written to appeal to a vast and diverse audience. It provides numerous jewels of information for the general reader as well as senior military leaders, military operational planners and supporters, interagency personnel, and U.S. political leaders who are looking for a provocative read to aid them in making informed decisions in support of U.S. national security. Since its first publication, this visionary book has ignited others in public and private life to read, research, write, and advocate for the United States to change its defense posture in order to meet the challenge posed by the advent of 4GW. Many of Hammes&#x2019; ideas have now been adopted by the military and are currently in practice in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other ideas are being studied extensively within the Washington Beltway. U.S. homeland security and counterinsurgency doctrines have also been strongly influenced and shaped by this book. Hammes has truly been a catalyst for change ... Hammes&#x2019;s book is truly an enlightening must-read for Military Review&#x2019;s readers, particularly those attending career military schools.

It is also a gutsy book because the author, a serving officer, asserts in effect that the Secretary of Defense, his team in the Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are wrong in the way they are fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He further contends that the United States stands a good chance of losing its wars in the future unless the forces confront the realities of warfare in this century.&#x201d;</p><h2>Project Paper Doll The Hunt</h2><p>Ariane Tucker has finally escaped GTX, the research facility that created her.

When Susannah Dean is transported via a magic door on the outskirts of Calla Bryn Sturgis (the scene of much of <i>The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla</i>) to New York City in the summer of 1999, the "demon-mother" who possesses her, Mia, has only one thing on her mind. She must give birth to her "chap" at a predetermined location in Manhattan's East 60s, as instructed by the henchmen-or "Low Men"-of the evil Crimson King. Pressed for time, Father Callahan, preteen Jake and talking pet "billy-bumbler" Oy follow Susannah and Mia's trail in an effort to prevent an act that would quicken the destruction of the Dark Tower and, in turn, of all worlds. Meanwhile, gunslingers Roland and Eddie travel to 1977 Maine in search of bookstore owner Calvin Tower, who is being hunted down by mobster Enrico Balazar and his gang, who first appeared in Eddie's version of New York in <i>The Drawing of the Three</i> Avid readers of the series will either be completely enthralled or extremely irritated when, in a gutsy move, the author weaves his own character into this unpredictable saga, but either way there's no denying the ingenuity with which King paints a candid picture of himself. The sixth installment of this magnum opus stops short with the biggest cliffhanger of King's career, but readers at the edge of their seats need only wait a few short months (<i>Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower</i>) to find out how-and if-King's fictional universe will come to an end. 10 full-color illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The beauty queen masquerading as an El Al stewardess had slunk through first class to tell each of the ten passengers individually and somewhat breathlessly that the captain would soon be turning on the seat-belt sign in preparation for landing at Ben Gurion Airport. David had paid close attention to her every word and the effect they had on her quivering superstructure. At these prices she better be a beauty queen, he thought, although one look back into the coach section upon boarding had confirmed the wisdom of electing first class. The crowd back there was somewhat eclectic. <br>It was early afternoon as the Airbus descended toward Tel Aviv over the eastern Mediterranean. Virgil&#x2019;s famously wine-dark sea glittered out the window, except that it was a deep blue, edged with precisely aligned, spidery whitecaps. The sea actually looked chilly. Well, why not, he thought. It was the first week in September, which meant that he would be visiting Israel four weeks before the major religious holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, compliments of careful planning. Landing and getting through security, immigration, and customs would be the first hurdles, especially with some of his special equipment. He had all the proper paperwork, which was good because the Israelis were extremely thorough about entry paperwork. The portable computer and his scuba regulator pack should not be a problem. Some of the seismic sensor stuff might attract attention, but it was pretty well disguised as part of his underwater camera equipment. Besides, everything had made it through the equally strict El Al security inspection back at Dulles, so he was fairly confident he would get it past the security people here in Tel Aviv. Immigration would be relatively pro forma for an American tourist, and customs, well, who ever knew about customs. <br>He swallowed as the cabin pressure was adjusted. He caught the beauty queen looking at him. In her tight-fitting uniform she could adjust the cabin pressure just by sitting down, he thought. He smiled at her and she smiled back, but it was a professional smile and not any indication of interest, he decided. He turned away, looking out the window for a first glimpse of Israel, but there was only the sea, a bit closer as the big jet bumped gently through light coastal clouds. He&#x2019;d been planning this thing for a year now, ever since Adrian had disappeared. It still made his spine tingle when he thought about what he was going to attempt here and what he might discover on that haunted mountain down at the literal bottom of the world. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; the man with the pockmarked face breathed into the public pay phone, his face averted from the shuffling crowd of bleary-eyed tourists streaming past him from the customs hall. <br>&#x201c;Anyone meet him besides his driver?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. Shall I follow them out to the car, or are we done here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You know the answer to that one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just thought I&#x2019;d ask.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shall I run that question by the boss for you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you, no.&#x201d; The man in the phone booth was silent for a moment. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll confirm him in the car, and again at the hotel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, you will.&#x201d; <br>The watcher mouthed a silent insult, hung up, and hastened down the carpeted aisle of the customs area, keeping the big American and his driver in sight over the shoulders of the milling tourists. He thought this was all something of a waste of time: What did they think this American was going to do, jump in a <i>sherut</i> at the last minute and whisk off to Amman to see the king? According to his supervisor, they had the American&#x2019;s official Israeli government itinerary, his hotel, his driver&#x2014;what the hell was the big deal? A nobody nuclear engineer turned whistle-blower who was now famous in Washington for winning a seven-figure settlement after suing his former employer for wrongful termination. Coming to Israel to play amateur archaeologist, do some skindiving, and then go home. Ridiculous. Who could care? He wondered again whom he had pissed off to get a shit detail like this on a Friday afternoon. <br>The throng of tourists bunched up again at the row of glass doors leading out to the public transportation area, and the watcher turned to look out the windows when his subject stopped. The American, David Hall, seemed to take the delay in stride, indicating that the driver should put the bags down for a minute, let the crowds ahead clear out. The American carried one large, awkward-looking case, probably his diving gear. He also carried what appeared to be a portable computer. The driver was humping two large suitcases and an overnight bag on an airport cart. Hall was holding on to that portable computer like it was his baby. <br>Trying not to be too obvious about it, the watcher confirmed the briefed description: Caucasian male, close to two meters in height, late thirties, barrel-chested, eighty, maybe ninety kilos, black hair laced with some gray, square face, a Semitic nose that would make a rabbi proud, prominent chin, and the tanned complexion of an outdoorsman. This Hall fellow didn&#x2019;t look like an engineer at all, certainly not like the Israeli engineers and scientists the watcher had seen on the telly. This one had big, strong-looking hands, wide shoulders, and a lot of solid muscle under that expensive sport coat. In that regard he truly stood out from the rest of the tourists, who were mostly old and overweight. Hall: Was that a Jewish name in America? He certainly had the Moses nose for it. <br>The watcher took care not to stare directly. His instincts told him that the American appeared to be aware of his surroundings. He was definitely looking around in a manner that belied his informal, relaxed pose with the driver. The briefer had mentioned that there was an intelligence interest in this American, although what that was had not been explained. Even so, the watcher had been instructed to pay attention to his tradecraft, because there was always the possibility that this American had had some field training. The watcher looked at him again. No way, he thought. Guy looks like a rich playboy, with all that fancy luggage and his fashionably thin computer. <br>One of the ubiquitous airport security teams, consisting of a man and a woman in rumpled army khakis, strolled by, the noses of their shoulder-slung submachine guns pointing lazily at the floor. They looked like brother and sister. They gave the nondescript Israeli lounging against a concrete pillar, dressed in tan slacks and a cheap sport shirt, the once-over and then, recognizing him for what he was, looked immediately away and kept going. By then the crowd at the doors was thinning out and the American was helping his driver gather up the bags, and then they were pushing through the glass doors to the usual chaos outside. The watcher followed them from inside the terminal building, observing until they stopped at a shiny if elderly four-door white Mercedes. <br>The watcher waited for the American to get in the car, right rear seat, just like some stuck-up officer. Next stop would be the Dan Tel Aviv Hotel, unless of course they really were going to make a quick getaway and go underground to meet some CIA fiends. Right. Wanting a cigarette, he glanced at his watch. Four forty-five, almost Shabbat, so of course all the CIA agents would be bellied up to the bar at the Sheraton by now. The watcher was not religious, but he was definitely ready for a day off. This American was boring, like most of them. At least he wasn&#x2019;t fat, like most of them. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright 2012 by P. T.

But not anymore. Stealing a small arsenal of guns from a neighbor, they take their classmates hostage at a school dance. In the panic of this desperate situation, it soon becomes clear that only one thing matters to Brendan and Gary: revenge.</p><p>High school sophomores Gary Searle and Brendan Lawlor have had enough. Day in and day out, for more than two years, they have been harassed, beaten up, and cursed out by most of the jocks at Middleton High--especially by football player Sam Flach. Armed with guns they've stolen from a neighbor's collection, Gary and Brendan storm a school dance, booby trap all the doors with homemade bombs, and prepare to turn their high school caste system upside down with a violent show of force. When it's all over, Sam Flach is alive (but without any hope of a future football career), Gary has killed himself, and Brendan is in a coma, after being beaten almost to death by other students who managed to disarm him. Could this tragedy have been prevented? Who, if anyone, is to blame?<p> Consisting of short, related statements from students, parents, school administrators, and even the troubled shooters themselves, <i>Give a Boy a Gun</i> attempts to give a voice to the countless sides of the school violence issue. Is this novel disturbing and at times difficult to read? Yes, of course it is. But it is also an articulate, well-rounded cross section of the many viewpoints on gun control, peer bullying, and the high school social order since the traumatic events that took place in Littleton, Colorado. While Strasser readily acknowledges that there are no easy solutions to the problem of school violence, this powerful book will be a useful tool for parents and teachers alike in exploring this issue and finding some ways of resolving the tragic escalation of teen violence.

Rank and the infamous Ponce de Crayon, Vegas&#x2019;s most glamorous tiger tamer? Is she playing Lick&#x2013;or is it love? <br><br>Will Al Bean&#x2019;s cockeyed schemes, an able assist from Cody, Lick&#x2019;s cowboy sidekick, a brigade of old-time rodeo reunioneers, and a few miles of duct tape be enough to stop F. Rank&#x2019;s nefarious plan, reform a career party girl, and change the hearts and minds of ten of the world&#x2019;s most thrill-seeking billionaires? Can Cody keep Lick from climbing onto raging bull Kamikaze&#x2019;s back one more time? Can true love triumph over shoot-outs at the not-so-okay corral and close encounters with white tigers?

He lives in Arizona among the catclaw and Gila monsters.<b>November 27, 1986: Lick and Al in Camp</b><br>Lick looked around. There wasn't nobody there. Of course there wasn't nobody there. Just him and the old man on a winter camp somewhere north of the Nevada line in the wilds of Owyhee County.<br><br>The camp was a twenty-year-old, sixty-five-foot single-wide New Moon house trailer that the company had pulled out here in the middle of a piece of high desert called Pandora's Thumb. Good enough for two cowboys to bach and take care of four hundred cows on winter range.<br><br>The old man had a car. An old four-door Ford sedan that hadn't had a current emissions sticker in ten years and seldom ran without tinkering. The ranch manager brought them groceries every Wednesday from Bruneau, Idaho, a good two-hour drive. No phone, no fax, no electricity. No Kwik Chek, Wal-Mart, Denny's, Backyard Burger, Pizza Hut, roping arena, therapist, or tanning salon. No contact with the outside world except that weekly visit.<br><br>"What's the matter with you, Al? Ain't nobody here."<br><br>"Git my gun, kid. I think they're fixin' to overrun the bunker! Them Huns kin sure fight. I know. I've played cards with 'em. Drunk their whiskey, danced their women, and done their polka. And kid"&#x2014;Al lifted his head conspiratorily&#x2014;"I never did like beer. Took too long to git drunk. Like enterin' the Dixie 500 in a Ford Pinto. Ya spend all yer time just gettin' there.<br><br>"Did I ever tellya 'bout the time I shot down one of our own planes?" Al paused. A curtain pulled over his eyes. The old man's head crashed back onto the bunk and within five breaths he was snoring like a diesel.<br><br>Lincoln Delgado Davis, or Lick, as he was known, was a long way from his college degree, his failed marriage, and his fizzled attempt at rodeo. Thirty-four, single, and beholden to no one, he was ambivalent about his future. The word "career" wasn't part of his vocabulary. He'd signed on with this outfit because he wanted to do some ranch cowboyin'. He'd spent time in feedlots and figgered this would be different. It was.<br><br>Bein' stuck with the old man wasn't so bad. In the two months they'd been together, first at the headquarters and now here, the old man had been through several hallucinatory spells like tonight. Wuddn't no big deal. Lick didn't know exactly how old the old man was. He was cagey about tellin'. Maybe he didn't know himself, but Lick assumed he was long past retirement age.<br><br>One thing for sure, he did look old. Al's gray hair was thin and about gone on top. His bare head had probably seen less sun than a Carlsbad Caverns bat. In the facial latitudes south of his hat brim his skin was as soft and supple as a welding glove. Years of toasting his ups and downs had left a road map of broken veins across his rosy cheeks and nose.<br><br>His eyes were faded blue and his fighting weight, which he claimed to have maintained since coming of age, was 146. We can assume that was fully dressed. He stood five foot eight when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943. Out of kindness, one might characterize him as wiry, maybe spry. In the cowboy vernacular, he was just a pore doer.<br><br>Lick drew the covers up around the old man, turned down the propane lamp, and clanked into the kitchen. The wind whistled through the window edges where the duct tape had come loose. He put on his hat, coat, and gloves and headed out the back door to do the nightly check on the dogs and the horses. October had been mild. Fifty degrees during the day, twenties at night. But yesterday November had kicked Indian summer in the butt with a cold front that brought out the long johns. Low bruised clouds, sleet scraped off God's windshield, and wind that penetrated like taco grease on a cheap paper plate.<br><br>Lick looked up at the ugly night sky. The dogs were curled underneath the trailer on the leeward side where the skirt was broken. Gonna be nasty tomorrow, he thought to himself, but so what, I ain't goin' nowhere. He checked the two saddle horses standin' hipshot and dozin' up against the windbreak. They had three more horses in a fifty-acre trap down by the creek. Brownie and Bill, the old man's dogs, came sniffin' outta their hole beneath the trailer to help Lick make his rounds. He chopped a little ice in the horse tank with a short post and stood with his back to the wind, lookin' east. I been worse, thought Lick. I been worse.<br><br>A shot rang out! And it could dang sure ring out where the nearest neighbor was twenty-two miles away. The initial blast was followed by four more rounds. Lick raced back to the trailer.<br><br>"I think I got one of 'em!" the old man said as he stood in the doorway, obviously revived from his alcohol-induced blackout. He held a smoking .30-30 in his hands. "Rustlers, I reckon, or car thieves," he said.<br><br>Lick looked at the old faded turquoise Ford with renewed interest. It still sat like a tilted tombstone on the flat front tire. He thought he noticed a new bullet hole in the front fender.<br><br>"How 'bout some coffee, Al," suggested Lick.<br><br>The old man levered out a spent shell and pulled the trigger. The hammer fell on the empty chamber. "Might as well," he said. "I'm outta bullets."<br><br>"Don't forget the Milnot," reminded the old man when they were back in the kitchen.<br><br>Lick dug a can of evaporated milk out of the fridge door. "Got it right here." The fact that it was Pet milk and not Milnot never caused a problem. They sat at the Formica table with its sixties-modern aluminum tubular legs.<br><br>"Ya know, kid, I been thinkin'. Maybe I oughta go see some of my old friends. My old rodeo buddies, some of them fellers I cowboyed with. I used to ride bulls. It's a fact. I never won Pendleton or Calgary, nuthin' like that, but I had some good rides.<br><br>"Anyway, I ain't married to this oufit, although they've always treated me good. But I've got a sister somewhere. Washington, maybe, or Wisconsin, one of them 'W' states, I can't remember. But maybe I should just pop in and surprise her. I ain't seen her for twenty or thirty years. And I reckon I oughta do it 'fore I git too dang old to travel. Hell, you could go with me. I could be your guide. I got a little money, ya know. Lewis has been puttin' half my paycheck in a bank for me ever' month for however long I been here. Fifteen years, I think. Or twenty, or maybe it's fourteen. Anyway, it's a bunch."<br><br>Lick leaned back and let the old man talk. He himself was makin' eight hundred and fifty bucks a month plus board, food and horses furnished. He figured the old man to be making more. Maybe over a thousand. Lewis Ola, the ranch manager, always officially treated the old man like he was in charge. Lick did what he could to help and didn't worry about it.<br><br>He pried off his boots and propped his feet up on the extra kitchen chair. The winter wind and extended exposure had given his olive skin a sculptured look. He needed a haircut again. His thick black hair and his coloring were a gift from his Spanish grandfather on his mother's side. The heavy black moustache showed no gray but was looking ratty. He was an inch taller than the old man and twenty pounds heavier. He relaxed and tuned out the old man's ramblings.<br><br>Last payday they'd taken the old Ford and driven to Elko, Nevada, three hours to the south. The old man told him he'd gone to Elko every payday, once a month, since long before Lick had come on board. "Like 'clarkwork,'" he'd said, "if the car's runnin'."<br><br>Lick had spent his last ten years on the rodeo circuit, so he'd had plenty of harrowing experiences on the road. He was better prepared than most, but he did get his eyebrows raised more than once riding in that old car with the old man driving. He found himself with his hands pressed against the dashboard more times than he could count. The track out to the highway was nothing but ruts and boulders for the first four miles. It had taken an hour. The next three or four miles wound through several hairpin curves and drop-offs before it leveled out and continued fifteen miles onto the blacktop.<br><br>Lewis always paid the old man the unbanked half of his check in cash. When they arrived in Elko, Lick cashed his check at the bank. The old man went directly to the Stockmen's Casino bar. Lick did a little shopping and a lot of looking at Capriola Saddlery. An hour later, he wandered into the Stockmen's looking for the old man. He wasn't hard to find. He was leaned against the bar in conversation with another cowboy and a woman.<br><br>"Hey, kid," barked the old man. "You need a drink!" It wasn't a question. He turned to the barkeep. "A whiskey and water for the kid and another for me and my friends."<br><br>Lick glanced at his watch. It read 1:00 p.m. Which meant it was noon, Nevada time. For the next three days they only left the bar to play blackjack, eat the occasional scrambled egg, and venture across the railroad tracks. The old man would drink till he got tired. There was a corner booth with a padded bench where they'd lay him down sometimes. On at least two occasions Lick and Al slept in the car.<br><br>On the fourth morning, the old man reached over from the backseat and shook Lick awake. "Kid," he said, "I reckon we'd better head back, I'm outta money. I hope you got enough to get gas."<br><br>The old man pushed his chair back from the table. The scraping of chair legs on the floor brought Lick back to the present.<br><br>"Time for a little shut-eye, kid. I done checked the horses."</p><h2>Paradise to Prison: Studies in Genesis</h2><p><i>Paradise to Prison</i> is a commentary, textbook and complete study guide to the book of Genesis. In very readable fashion the author explores the lives of the patriarchs as well as important doctrinal themes. Each chapter is carefully documented and sources from archaeology and ancient Near Eastern history are freely used. The writer's premise is that no other ancient literature surviving the ravages of time can rightly be compared to Genesis with its unsurpassed theological perspectives and vivid profiles of early man.</p><p>Sheffield Publishing Company is pleased to add this excellent and popular book to our list of reissues! <i>Paradise to Prison</i> has, for years, been considered among the best of commentaries on the book of Genesis from an evangelical perspective. Originally, the hardcover format's price may have made it difficult to consider as a supplementary text. We've reissued it as a paperback with a price that will make it affordable to students!In spite of changing trends and shifting theological interests, the Book of Genesis continues to command the attention of scholars throughout the world. The simplicity of its narratives and the inexhaustibility of its spiritual truth make its charm and value enduring. <p> Moses takes the reader from an awesome, sinless paradise to death and burial in Egypt. In between are his grand descriptions of the origin and fall of man, the destruction of the world by water, the judgement of Babel, and the exciting adventures of the Hebrew patriarchs. </p><p> Any modern study of Genesis must consider the vast array of material unearthed by archaeologists in the Near East. Where appropriate, we have also discussed the Hebrew text, geography, and ancient cultures. Comparisons between Genesis and its cultural background will not alone yield proper interpretations, however; the text still must be compared with other potions of Scripture. </p><p> Because space is limited, the biblical text is not quoted to any extent; we recommend that the reader have a Bible at hand while working through this volume. </p><p> Finally, we have attempted to make the study of Genesis practical and spiritually rewarding as well as intellectually informative. It is my hope that all who read this book will be drawn closer to the God of whom Moses spoke so eloquently.</p></p><h2>In the Country: Stories</h2><p>These nine globe-trotting, unforgettable stories from Mia Alvar, a remarkable new literary talent, vividly give voice to the women and men of the Filipino diaspora.

All of them have ecological advantages in comparison to standard construction systems, since they represent a more effective use of resources and a reduction of construction time and there with costs. All houses are built in factories, carried by road and assembled on site. Thus, building materials can be used more economically and very few refuse is produced during construction. Due to the actual spread of technologies and construction typologies, the international prefabrication industry can deliver up-to-date houses, aesthetically modern, and with an average rank of prizes from very cheap solutions to more exclusive ones, depending on the main material used (wood, steel, galvanised aluminum and concrete).</p><p></p><h2>Macrame&#x301;: A Golden hands pattern book</h2><p>Macrame, the wonderful art of knotting, is an ancient craft that apparently originated in the Middle East.

He is perhaps most appreciated by members of the Carmelite Order, known for its contemplative and pastoral orientation.<br> Elijah is considered their legendary founder and traditional patron. Carmelites rank him as one of their greatest spiritual models. Their coat of arms displays his flaming sword, Mount Carmel, and Elijah's proclamation, "With zeal I have been zealous for the Lord God of Hosts." This book inquires into this deep appreciation. It examines the linkage between the Order and the prophet over time.<br><br>Beginning with the oldest knowledge we have about Elijah, coming from Scripture, Elijah Prophet of Carmel briefly sketches his role in the three faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It then turns to what the distant, but influential, Christian antecedents of the Carmelite Order, the desert hermits and the early Fathers, wrote about the zealous man of God.<br> As the Carmelite Order was founded, achieved its corporate identity, and changed over time, so did its views of its legendary model. Interaction between storytelling about Elijah and Carmelites' understanding of themselves continues even to the present. As thoughts from the past about the prophet continue to influence them, both Teresian Carmelites and Carmelites of the Ancient Observance of our times are developing a brand-new tradition of him, the tradition of Elijah's double charism.</p><p>Jane Ackerman is Associate Professor of Religion at The University of Tulsa.

Few spoke; even the chants of the sky pirates up in front tailed off, and the only sounds were the barks and yelps of the prowlgrins and the relentless <i>slap, slap, slap</i> of mud-shoes on mire mud.<br><br>The grey afternoon gave way to the dim half-light of evening, and the wind grew stronger once more, pelting them with heavy rain that stung their faces and soaked them to the skin.<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s the Edgeland wind,&#x2019; called back the librarian on the library sledge. &#x2018;We must be getting close!&#x2019; He cracked the whip and urged the yelping prowlgrins on.<br><br>The rope round Rook&#x2019;s middle jerked taut, forcing him to quicken his pace. All round him, the air was filled with curses and moans as the marchers struggled to keep up.<br><br>Suddenly, rising above it all, there came the noise of squelching mud, and a curious <i>plaff-plaff</i> sound. Rook looked up. To the left of the column, a cluster of low mud-dunes seemed to be approaching, rising and falling in a slippery rhythm as they did so.<br><br>&#x2018;MUGLUMPS!&#x2019;<br><br>The cry went up from the back of the column, where the Ghosts of Screetown had obviously spotted the danger.<br><br>The rope suddenly tugged Rook violently to the right as the librarian on the library sledge battled to control the panicking prowlgrins. Ahead, the four other sledges were in equal trouble. The low shapes were gathering and, from their path, it was obvious that the closely harnessed packs of prowlgrins were their intended prey.<br><br>Felix and his ghosts appeared out of the gloom on all sides. Fenbrus Lodd, Cowlquape beside him, shouted desperately to his son.<br><br>&#x2018;The library sledges! Felix!&#x2019; he screamed. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re after the sledges!&#x2019;<br><br>Rook was running now, with Xanth and the banderbears dragged behind him, as the library sledge careered across the mud.<br><br>&#x2018;Cut yourselves loose!&#x2019; shouted Felix to Rook and the other librarians, &#x2018;and follow the braziers of the sky pirates.&#x2019;<br><br>With a grunt, Rook tore at the knotted rope round his middle and slid to a halt as it fell free.<br><br>&#x2018;There!&#x2019; shouted Xanth, beside him. He pointed.<br><br>Ahead, Deadbolt stood on a mud-dune, waving a flaming purple brazier over his head as if possessed. &#x2018;Rally to me, Undertowners!&#x2019; he roared. &#x2018;Rally!&#x2019;<br><br>The huge library sledges slewed and skidded away to the right, the yelping screams of the prowlgrin teams drowning out the cries of their drivers. The mud-dunes seethed and boiled with the low, flapping shapes of the half-hidden muglumps in pursuit.<br><br>Panting, Rook reached Deadbolt, who was now surrounded by a huge crowd of mud-spattered and bewildered Undertowners. Xanth and the banderbears came lumbering up behind him.<br><br>&#x2018;There lie the Edgelands, Sky help us! We&#x2019;ll regroup there!&#x2019; shouted Deadbolt above the howling winds, and pointing to a low, grey ridge in the middle distance. &#x2018;Mothers and young&#x2019;uns first!&#x2019;<br><br>The Undertowners surged forwards across the glistening wind-flattened expanse of mud ahead, all eyes fixed on the distant ridge. Every one of them was driven by a desperate, half-mad frenzy to get out of the clinging mire mud and onto dry land. Rook was jostled and bumped as Undertowner after Undertowner barged past.<br><br>&#x2018;You heard him,&#x2019; Xanth shouted. &#x2018;Come on. We&#x2019;re nearly there, Rook!&#x2019;<br><br>But Rook shook his head. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a librarian knight,&#x2019; he said in a low voice, his words almost lost in the gusting wind. &#x2018;My place is with the library.&#x2019;<br><br>He turned back towards the library sledges. Xanth and the banderbears hesitated. It was obvious from their eyes that they shared the Undertowners&#x2019; mire-madness. Every fibre of their beings longed to be rid of the terrible white mud.<br><br>&#x2018;And our place is with you,&#x2019; said Xanth.<br><br>They turned and fought their way through the crowd, and back out into the Mire. The library sledges, like huge lumbering beasts, were away to the right, and had halted their mad dash. Now they seemed marooned, their tops bristling with librarians like hairs on a hammelhorn. As they approached, Rook could see why.<br><br>Felix and the ghosts were busy cutting the traces that harnessed the prowlgrin teams, while his father waved his hands in the air wildly, from on top of one of the sledges.<br><br>&#x2018;Stop! Stop!&#x2019; he was bellowing, but Felix ignored him as he cut through another tilderleather strap.<br><br>The slithering mounds had congregated in a flapping, slurping reef round the sledges, kept at bay for the moment by brazier-wielding ghosts &#x2013; but inching closer by the second.<br><br>Rook stopped. If they went any further, they risked straying into the midst of the muglump pack. He shook his head miserably. There was nothing they could do; they were helpless spectators. He sank to his knees in the cold white mud. How he hated the oozing filth that seemed to cling so, pulling you down, smothering the life out of you, until you were so weary you just didn&#x2019;t care any more...<br><br>All at once, the mire mud erupted in front of him. Felix had cut the last harness and given the signal. With piercing screams, the prowlgrins &#x2013; all two hundred and fifty of them &#x2013; stampeded out across the mudflats.<br><br>The mud-dunes closed in around them. Up out of the mud, the muglumps reared, in plain sight at last. Rook stared, transfixed with horror. The last time he&#x2019;d seen a muglump was with Felix, in the sewers of old Undertown &#x2013; but that sewerage-dweller seemed tame compared to these monsters. The size of a bull hammelhorn, with six thick-set limbs and a long whiplash tail, each muglump slithered through the soft mire mud just below the surface, breathing through flapped nostrils.<br><br>Now, with a bone-scraping screech, they pounced on the hapless prowlgrins...<br><br><b>Second extract</b><br><br><i>The Free Glades have stood as a beacon of hope for all in the Edgeworld. But the goblin leader - Hemtuft Battleaxe - has other plans for the Freegladers, as this extract from a meeting of the clan chiefs shows...</i><br><br>A vast crowd had assembled outside the great open-sided clan-hut of the long-hairs; a crowd packed with goblins of every description, all crushed together so tightly it was difficult even to breathe. Flat-heads and hammerheads, pink-eyed and scaly goblins; long-haired and tufted goblins, snag-toothed, saw-toothed and underbiter goblins; all were represented.<br><br>Inside the clan-hut, on a raised stage, sat Hemtuft Battleaxe of the long-hair goblin clan, leader of the Goblin Nations. Preening his shryke feathercloak, the grey-haired Battleaxe looked down from his carved wooden throne placed on top of a pile of skulls of deceased clan elders. On the platform before him stood the leaders of the four other clans, their heads bowed in supplication.<br><br>Rootrott Underbiter, clan chief of the tusked goblins, was the first to look up, his two massive canines glinting, his yellow eyes impassive. As leader of one of the larger clans, there was a look of sullen insolence on his face, despite his thin, twitching smile.<br><br>Next to him stood Lytugg, leader of the hammerhead clan, and granddaughter of the old mercenary, General Tytugg of Undertown. For one so young, she boasted an impressive array of battle scars as befitted the leader of the most warlike of all the goblin nations. <br><br>Beside her, sat the old, hunched figure of Meegmewl the Grey, clan chief of the lop-ears, as sharp-witted as he was ancient. Although the least warlike of the clans, the lop-ears were the most numerous by far, and Meegmewl was not to be underestimated.<br><br>Nor, for that matter, was Grossmother Nectarsweet the Second, clan chief of the symbites. She spoke for the gyle, tree, webfooted and gnokgoblins of the nations - the symbites who were responsible for such a rich array of products, everything from gyle-honey and dew-milk, to teasewood rope and lullabee grubs. Her five chins wobbled in a languid ripple as she raised her huge head and met Hemtuft's gaze levelly.<br><br>Hemtuft Battleaxe waved a hairy hand. As leader of the long-hairs and most senior of the goblin clans, his word was law. He knew though that, without the support of the other clans, the Goblin Nations would disintegrate and return to the roving, warring tribes they had been before. And that was something no one wanted.<br><br>'I understand, of course I do,' he said, as the crowd around the clan-hut jostled closer, trying to catch every word. 'Your lop-ear clan has paid a heavy price in supplying the labour to the Foundry Glades, and yet it is a price we must pay for the spears, the ploughs, the cooking-pots, and everything else that none of us would do without.'<br><br>'Say the word, and my hammerhead war bands could overrun the Foundry Glades like that,' said Lytugg, with a snap of her bony fingers.<br><br>Hemtuft shook his head. 'Lytugg, Lytugg. How many times must we go over this?' he said wearily. 'It is pointless to use force against the Foundry Glades. Hemuel Spume and the Furnace Masters would die before they revealed the secrets of their forges and workshops to us. And then where would we be? In charge of a lot of useless machinery that none of us could operate. No, if we are to succeed, we must pay the price the Furnace Masters demand of us...'<br><br>The skeletons of the old clan chief's predecessors, hanging- from the rafters of the huge thatched roof, clinked like bone wind-chimes in the breeze.<br><br>'But why must we pay it alone,' Meegmewl the Grey croaked, turning his milky eyes to the ceiling.<br><br>'Because there are so many of you,' retorted Rootrott Underbiter nastily.<br><br>'... And no hammerhead or flat-head shall stoke a furnace!' Lytugg snarled fiercely. 'We are warriors!'<br><br>Around Lob and Lummel, the hammerhead and flat-head goblins cheered and brandished their hefty clubs and spears.<br>&lt;...</p><h2>Counterparts</h2><p>The ten paired texts in Counterparts will challenge your assumptions and spark debate.

Usually traveling alone, Marent has been known to spend extraordinary lengths of time to get the perfect shot--sometimes 12 days. You can see the results in his first book, <i>Rainforest</i>. The book is his testament--an intimate collection of more than 500 breathtaking animal and plant portraits, and the fascinating stories behind them. <p> <strong>Questions for Thomas Marent</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What inspired you to start taking pictures? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> I used to be a birdwatcher in Switzerland--and soon I was also interested in amphibians, insects, and plants. After a while I thought it would be nice to have pictures of all these beautiful animals. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Waiting for the perfect shot takes patience and time. How do you decide what images are worth waiting for? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> I mostly focus on the colorful and spectacularly shaped creatures. Sometimes it is a matter of luck to find them, but sometimes I have to know where and when to look for them. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What photo in <i>Rainforest</i> is your favorite? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> I don't have one favorite--there are many favorites! I especially like the photos of frogs, butterflies, fungi, birds and weird insects. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What would people find most surprising about the world's rainforests? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> When people think of the rainforest, it's the monkeys, birds, and wild cats that first come to mind. But there are so many small and beautiful creatures. We need to see and appreciate them too--they're just a little harder to find! Many of these smaller creatures have never been seen by most people. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Do you consider yourself a rainforest activist? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> With the book I want to show to the people the endless beauty of the rainforests. I do hope that it might open the eyes of some people, so that they'll agree that it's worth protecting this fantastic environment. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Some of the photos in the book, especially some of the insect photos, are really strange and otherworldly. What's your favorite exotic rainforest animal? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> Some of my favorites always were frogs and butterflies, but birds and monkeys as well. And of course the weird-looking insects. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What's your favorite rainforest? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> In Asia it is Borneo. In Africa it is Madagascar. In Latin America it is Costa Rica and Peru/Colombia. But I also like the Australian and New Zealand rainforests. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Do you have any advice for amateur nature photographers? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> A tripod is an absolutely must. Try to move to the animals slowly and quietly--it takes some patience. Whenever possible try taking your pictures at the animal's eye level. And it's always important to think about the background when you compose the picture. </p>Over the past 16 years, Thomas Marent has traveled all over the world photographing rainforests, from Peru and Ecuador to New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.</p><h2>The Embroiderer&#39;s Flowers</h2><p>Flowers and embroidery have been inseparable on dress and furnishings from the age of Queen Elizabeth I up to the 20th century.

He is the author of Unionist-Nationalism: Governing Urban Scotland, 1830-1860 (Tuckwell Press, 1999), Locality, Community and Nation (Hodder and Stoughton, 1998) and a number of articles and essays in journals and edited volumes. He is also an occasional contributor to press and radio on matters to do with Scottish nationalism. He lives in Kirkcaldy, Fife."The Wallace story is part of Scotland's imagined community.... We can't break the story because there is no story." In this densely written scholarly study, the author, a professor at Edinburgh University, examines the legends that have surrounded the exploits of William Wallace (1274-1305). Wallace is credited with liberating Scotland by defeating the English at Stirling Bridge (1297); his stature as the savior of Scotland has been reinforced by the recent film Braveheart. Later Wallace was vanquished by Edward I of England at Falkirk (1298). He lived as an outlaw and guerilla fighter until he was betrayed to the English, tried and bloodily executed in 1305. The author researched the very slim historical sources available and found problems with corroborating evidence. Much of Wallace's early reputation, for example, rested on the verse of "blind Harry," who wrote in the late 15th century. According to Morton, Harry's poetry has been romanticized and is almost certainly filled with errors. Ballads, songs and biographies of later centuries extolling Wallace's heroism are based on patriotism rather than truth. Morton also investigates how the myth of Wallace served both Scottish nationalism and socialism. In recent years the Wallace cult has grown, due to video games and Web sites. Although the author does not argue for completely abandoning national myths that cannot be proven, his hope for the Wallace mystique is that it is time to "lay his ghost to rest." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Penguin English Library the Tenant of Wildfell Hall (The Penguin English Library)</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bront� &#39;She looked so like herself that I knew not how to bear it&#39; In this sensational, hard-hitting and passionate tale of marital cruelty, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall sees a mysterious tenant, Helen Graham, unmasked not as a &#39;wicked woman&#39; as the local gossips would have it, but as the estranged wife of a brutal alcoholic bully, desperate to protect her son. Using her own experiences with her brother Branwell to depict the cruelty and debauchery from which Helen flees, Anne Bront� wrote her masterpiece to reflect the fragile position of women in society and her belief in universal redemption, but scandalized readers of the time. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Over a short period in the 1840s, the three Bront� sisters working in a remote English <br>parsonage produced some of the best-loved and most-enduring of all novels: Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, a book that created a scandal when it was published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compelling in its imaginative power and bold naturalism, the novel opens in the autumn of 1827, when a mysterious woman who calls herself Helen Graham seeks refuge at the desolate moorland mansion of Wildfell Hall. Bront�'s enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every reader who has felt the power of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights comes, sooner or later, to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall," observed Bront� scholar Margaret Lane. "Anne Bront�, with all the Bront� taste for violence and drama, and with her experience of the same rude scenes and savage Yorkshire tales that had fed the imaginations of her sisters, did not shrink. She used the material at hand, and shaped it with singular honesty and seri-<br>ousness....Anne is a true Bront�." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell <br>Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Most had been requisitioned by the armed forces and, when de-requisitioned, were left to stand empty awaiting their owners&#39; return. It was then that John Harris first discovered country houses.;Between 1946 and 1961 he visited over 200 houses. Hitch-hiking or travelling on pre-Beeching branch lines, he sometimes stayed in youth hostels, sometimes on straw bales in the houses themselves. No house glimpsed through the trees or up an overgrown drive escaped his attention. From these visits and from country house sales he became aware of the riches that country houses contained - pictures, china, furniture, marble fireplaces - riches that were in danger of being lost for ever. Here we follow an architectural historian in search of his quarry.</p><p>`The demolition of these houses is a tragic story, but the author&#39;s battles with weather and hostile caretakers, and his discovery of unexpected treasures, are entertaining and beautifully written.&#39; Eric Anderson, Sunday Telegraph; `The best non-fiction book that I have read this year.&#39; Ursula Buchan, Spectator; `An intensely romantic, poignant, angry, frequently hilarious and hauntingly illustrated memoir.&#39; Hugh Massingberd, Daily TelegraphJohn Harris worked at NME during the height of Brit Pop and was Features Editor at Q and Editor of Select.

The stories are divided into three groups: Five fall into Sterling's "Shaper/Mechanist" coterie of tales; three are science fiction of a more generic type; and four tales are labeled as fantasy. The Shaper/Mechanist stories center on a future world in which two opposing sects have developed: the "Shapers" have evolved themselves through genetic tinkering; the "Mechanists" through computerized prosthetics. Sterling explores the consequences of both approaches, painting neither side as necessarily good nor evil, and stories are related Erom both points of view. Among the other tales, "20 Evocations" effectively links anecdotal episodes of Nikolai Leng's life to create a coherent picture of Leng's gradual transformation from young innocent to cornipt elder. In "Spook," the earth has suffered a "brain drain" through mass emigrations to space leaving a world populated mainly with "undesirables." The powers-diat-be have their hands full trying to maintain a semblance of order and control; faced with a potential uprising in Central America, they contract the services of a futuristic secret agent-the "spook" of the title-to quell the insurgency. The denouement to this space-age thriller is devasting. "Green Days in Brunei" is set in the tiny nation of Brunei on the island of Borneo to which Canadian engineer Turner Choi has been dispatched to help introduce a bit of twenty-first-century technology to a society that has previously rejected high tech to the point of outlawing telephones. Choi eventually becomes romantically involved with the royal princess of Brunei in this, what may well be Sterling's best story. The fantasy-oriented tales which close out the collection largely feature a tongue-in-cheek tone and are, unfortunately, not as interesting as the preceding works. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Sterling ( Islands in the Net ) is one of the very best young science fiction writers, and one of the foremost exponents of cyberpunk (he edited Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology ). His first collection brings together a dozen of his evocative, inventive, beautifully written stories. "Spook" tells of a future intelligence agent who is subjected to an operation that removes the psychologically limiting Veil implanted in his head, and then finds freedom untenable because it brings realization of all the suffering he has caused. "The Little Magic Shop" is a whimsical story about life-extending elixir, with a twist. Five of the stories are from the Shaper/Mechanist series, set in a future in which the two races war for the universe's resources. "Swarm" tells of a Shaper who craftily gathers some genetic material from the alien Swarm race with the intent of creating a slave population, but whose plans backfire spectacularly when his understanding of the Swarm proves less advanced than his technology. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Come Back Barbara</h2><p>Christian - interesting</p><p></p><h2>Monkey on a Stick: Murder, Madness, and the Hare Krishnas</h2><p>A former Hare Krishna follower&#39;s in vestigation into corrupt and criminal practices of the sect</p><p>This shocking expose by the journalist coauthors will disabuse readers that the Hare Krishna sect is exclusively a group of religious devotees. The movement began with the arrival in the United States in 1966 of Swami Prabhupada, who established himself as a charismatic teacher and as quickly attracted numerous disciples, one of whom was Keith Ham, a Columbia University graduate student who was given the Hindu name of Kirtanananda. As the movement grew, the founder appointed a group of regional leaders, Kirtanananda among them, who exercised almost unlimited power over the sect's adherents, many of them psychologically damaged people, according to the authors. Nationwide, some members financed the sect by selling drugs and soliciting money for nonexistent charities. Kirtanananda founded a colony called New Vrindaban in West Virginia, where wife-beating, child sexual abuse, rape and even murder took place. The authors document their charges from interviews with Hare Krishna defectors and police and court records, and the cumulative effect is chilling. 50,000 first printing; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club alternates; author tour. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Miss MacIntosh, my darling (A Harvest/HBJ book)</h2><p>This novel is one of the most ambitious and remarkable literary achievements of our time. It is a picaresque, psychological novel&#x2015;a novel of the road, a journey or voyage of the human spirit in its search for reality in a world of illusion and nightmare. It is an epic of what might be called the Arabian Nights of American life. Marguerite Young&#x2019;s method is poetic, imagistic, incantatory; in prose of extraordinary richness she tests the nature of her characters&#x2015;and the nature of reality.<br><br>Miss MacIntosh, My Darling is written with oceanic music moving at many levels of consciousness and perception; but the toughly fibred realistic fabric is always there, in the happenings of the narrative, the humor, the precise details, the definitions of the characters. Miss MacIntosh herself, who hails from What Cheer, Iowa, and seems downright and normal, with an incorruptible sense of humor and the desire to put an end to phantoms; Catherine Cartwheel, the opium lady, a recluse who is shut away in a great New England seaside house and entertains imaginary guests; Mr. Spitzer, the lawyer, musical composer and mystical space traveler, a gentle man, wholly unsure of himself and of reality; his twin brother Peron, the gay and raffish gambler and virtuoso in the world of sports; Cousin Hannah, the horsewoman, balloonist, mountain-climber and militant Boston feminist, known as Al Hamad through all the seraglios of the East; Titus Bonebreaker of Chicago, wildman of God dreaming of a heavenly crown; the very efficient Christian hangman, Mr. Weed of the Wabash River Valley; a featherweight champion who meets his equal in a graveyard&#x2015;these are a few who live with phantasmagorical vividness in the pages of Miss MacIntosh, My Darling.<br><br>The novel touches on many aspects of life&#x2015;drug addiction, woman&#x2019;s suffrage, murder, suicide, pregnancy both real and imaginary, schizophrenia, many strange loves, the psychology of gambling, perfectionism; but the profusion of this huge book serves always to intensify the force of the central question: &#x201c;What shall we do when, fleeing from illusion, we are confronted by illusion?&#x201d; What is real, what is dream? Is the calendar of the human heart the same as that kept by the earth? Is it possible that one may live a secondary life of which one does not know?<br><br>In every aspect, Miss MacIntosh, My Darling stands by itself&#x2015;in the lyric beauty of its prose, its imaginative vitality and cumulative emotional power.

No matter what his parents say, Pierre just doesn't care. <blockquote> "What would you like to eat?"<br> "I don't care!"<br> "Some lovely cream of wheat?"<br> "I don't care!"<br> Don't sit backwards on your chair."<br> "I don't care!"<br> "Or pour syrup on your hair."<br> "I don't care!"<br> </blockquote><p> Even when a hungry lion comes to pay a call, Pierre won't snap out of his ennui. Every child has one of these days sometimes. Mix in a stubborn nature, a touch of apathy, and a haughty pout, and it can turn noxious. Parents may cajole, scold, bribe, threaten--all to no avail. When this mood strikes, the Pierres of the world will not budge, even for the carnivorous king of beasts. Created by one of the best-loved author-illustrators of children's books, Maurice Sendak, this 1962 cautionary tale is hardly a pedantic diatribe against children who misbehave. Still, by the end of the lilting, witty story, most children will take the moral (Care!) to heart. Pierre's downward-turned eyebrows, his parents' pleading faces, and the lion's almost sympathetic demeanor as he explains that he will soon eat Pierre, make the package perfect.

In the last decade alone, China joined the World Trade Organization, hosted the 2008 Olympics and experienced a remarkable, record-high increase in its foreign currency reserves. As these changes unfold, frequency of contact between the Chinese and Westerners is dramatically increasing in the office, the classroom and the home.<br><br>With thought-provoking glimpses into history and tradition, <i>Encountering the Chinese</i> provides fundamental information on Chinese cultural norms and values, giving clear context for contemporary social standards. Readers will learn the etiquette necessary to build successful personal and professional relationships with the Chinese both inside and outside the People's Republic of China. <br><br>This revised edition of Encountering the Chinese also explains how Chinese values are changing rapidly-and why it is more important than ever to keep up. For instance, compliments, once declined out of modesty, are now widely accepted in coastal cities; and some terms of address that were proper to use only a decade ago have grown offensive.

A picaresque tale, this chronicle of their trip meanders along scenic backroads and speeds along anonymous superhighways, moving from small towns to growing cities to glorious wilderness oases. Travels with Charley is animated by Steinbeck&#39;s attention to the specific details of the natural world and his sense of how the lives of people are intimately connected to the rhythms of nature - to weather, geography, the cycles of the seasons. His keen ear for the transactions among people is evident, too, as he records the interests and obsessions that preoccupy the Americans he encounters along the way.<b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <b>Cup of Gold</b> (1929).<p>After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <b>The Pastures of Heaven</b> (1932) and <b>To a God Unknown</b> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <b>The Long Valley</b> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <b>Tortilla Flat </b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <b>In Dubious Battle</b> (1936), <b>Of Mice and Men</b> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1939). <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> won both the <b>National Book Award</b> and the <b>Pulitzer Prize</b> in 1939.</p><p>Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <b>The Forgotten Village</b> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <b>Sea of Cortez</b> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <b>The Moon is Down</b> (1942). <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945), <b>The Wayward Bus</b> (1948), another experimental drama, <b>Burning Bright</b> (1950), and <b>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</b> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <b>East of Eden</b> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.</p><p>The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <b>Sweet Thursday</b> (1954), <b>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</b> (1957), <b>Once There Was a War </b>(1958), <b>The Winter of Our Discontent </b>(1961), <b>Travels with Charley in Search of America </b>(1962), <b>America and Americans</b> (1966), and the posthumously published <b>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</b> (1969), <b>Viva Zapata!</b> (1975), <b>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</b> (1976), and <b>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1989).</p><p>Steinbeck received the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature</b> in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the <b>United States Medal of Freedom</b> by President Lyndon B.

"My wife's been unfaithful," he declares in the opening line, "this much I have long suspected." That fixed idea, whether or not founded on truth, haunts him throughout the book-long interior monologue, set mostly in Paris and London. He himself feels free to engage in some dalliances, but his French wife Lizzy remains fixed in his mind as a treacherous, "depraved woman," a hussy of "loose" morals. Attentive readers, meanwhile, are given good reason to believe he is the helpless victim of a delusion. So mesmerized is Jacob that even after Lizzy's death in Barcelona (long after their divorce), he imagines he sees her fleetingly in the street. Her reappearance, he tells himself, gives meaning and purpose to his life"or else why go on living?" As it turns out, the brooding story is not about his wife, as the title ironically promises, but about his own futile life. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Selected Essays from the &#34;Rambler&#34;, &#34;Adventurer&#34; and &#34;Idler&#34; (Yale Edition of the Works of Samuel Johnson)</h2><p>This selection of the cream of the writing from Volumes II-V of the Yale Edition of the Works of Samuel Johnson fills the largest remaining gap in easily available eighteenth-century texts for the student and general reader.

Scott Bakker has become one of the most celebrated voices in fantasy literature. With The Great Ordeal, Bakker presents the long-anticipated third volume of The Aspect-Emperor, a series that stands with the finest in the genre for its grandiose scope, rich detail, and thrilling story. &nbsp; As Fanim war-drums beat just outside the city, the Empress Anas�rimbor Esmenet searches frantically throughout the palace for her missing son Kelmomas. Meanwhile and many miles away, Esmenet&#x2019;s husband&#x2019;s Great Ordeal continues its epic march further north. But in light of dwindling supplies, the Aspect-Emperor&#x2019;s decision to allow his men to consume the flesh of fallen Sranc could have consequences even He couldn&#x2019;t have foreseen. And, deep in Ishu�l, the wizard Achamian grapples with his fear that his unspeakably long journey might be ending in emptiness, no closer to the truth than when he set out. &nbsp; The Aspect-Emperor series follows Bakker&#x2019;s Prince of Nothing saga, returning to the same world twenty years later. The Great Ordeal follows The Judging Eye and The White-Luck Warrior, and delivers the first half of the conclusion to this epic story. Returning to Bakker&#x2019;s richly imagined universe of myth, violence, and sorcery, The Aspect-Emperor continues to set the bar for the fantasy genre, reaching new heights of intricacy and meaning.</p><p><b>R.

Their efforts resulted in an &#x201c;ethnicized&#x201d; interpretation of Mexicanness that intentionally incorporated elements of folk and indigenous culture. In this rich history, Rick A. L�pez explains how thinkers and artists, including the anthropologist Manuel Gamio, the composer Carlos Ch�vez, the educator Mois�s S�enz, the painter Diego Rivera, and many less-known figures, formulated and promoted a notion of nationhood in which previously denigrated vernacular arts&#x2014;dance, music, and handicrafts such as textiles, basketry, ceramics, wooden toys, and ritual masks&#x2014;came to be seen as symbolic of Mexico&#x2019;s modernity and national distinctiveness. L�pez examines how the nationalist project intersected with transnational intellectual and artistic currents, as well as how it was adapted in rural communities. He provides an in-depth account of artisanal practices in the village of Olinal�, located in the mountainous southern state of Guerrero. Since the 1920s, Olinal� has been renowned for its lacquered boxes and gourds, which have been considered to be among the &#x201c;most Mexican&#x201d; of the nation&#x2019;s arts. <i>Crafting Mexico</i> illuminates the role of cultural politics and visual production in Mexico&#x2019;s transformation from a regionally and culturally fragmented country into a modern nation-state with an inclusive and compelling national identity.</p><p>&#34;In recent decades, historians of twentieth-century Mexico have reshaped the way we understand state and nation formation--particularly popular constructions of the national--and the role that foreign actors have played in brokering Mexico&#39;s distinctive, transnational process of becoming modern. &#34;Crafting Mexico&#34; represents a culminating moment in these inquiries. Better than any study I know, it wrestles with the complex process whereby Mexico transformed itself from a fragmented society, driven by regional loyalties, linguistic and cultural particularism, and caudillo politics, into one of the hemisphere&#39;s most unified nations. Part of the answer, Rick A. Lopez argues masterfully, lies in a surprisingly contingent aesthetic and political process that embraced foreign and local actors, cosmopolitan intellectuals and indigenous crafts producers, and a panoply of state and private initiatives. Deftly integrating analytical and spatial dimensions, and bridging temporal boundaries, &#34;Crafting Mexico&#34; is a substantial achievement.&#34;--Gilbert M.

A seventeenth-century French Carmelite, Brother Lawrence spent much of his time in the kitchen of a Paris monastery. Of this experience, he said: "The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen ... I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament."<br>A collection of Lawrence's messages given to those who lived around him, this book contains <i>The Practice of the Presence of God</i> and <i>The Spiritual Maxims</i>. Both have much to say to modern man about living a spiritual life in a busy world. More widely read today than ever, these two classics &#x2014; each an easily accessible primer of practical Christian devotion &#x2014; comprise a particularly good selection with which to begin spiritual studies.</p><p>Brother Lawrence: Brother Lawrence was a seventeenth-century French monk who in his monastery kitchen discovered an overwhelming delight in God&#39;s presence.This new edition is helpful to the average reader because it situates Lawrence...within the historical context of his times. But its greatest benefit for such readers is that it provides them with a fresh, readable translation of a classic of Christian literature. --Wendy M. Wright, Weavings<br><br>This faithfully translated new edition is the most complete and comprehensive text on Brother Lawrence available. --Gerald E.

The secret of Germany&#39;s early successes and the reason for its eventual failure are disclosed in this analysis by a brilliant former general of the German Army. Major General von Mellenthin, who saw action in every theater of the European war from 1939 to 1945, follows the panzer armies through Poland, France, the Balkans, across the deserts of North Africa and the frozen wastes of Russia, to the final defeat on the Western front. It was the decisive victories of the German panzer divisions in North Africa that taught the Allies the importance of an integrated combat team consisting of tanks, infantry and artillery. Panzer Battles provides an especially vivid account of the legendary desert battles fought by Rommel. The continued timeliness of Mellenthin&#39;s work was brought home in the First Gulf War by General Norman Schwarzkopf, who kept the book on his desk throughout the conflict. Panzer Battles is a candid and forthright discussion of the War that reflects not only von Mellenthin&#39;s intimate knowledge of the workings of the German General Staff, but a thorough familiarity with the Allies&#39; strategic aims. It is a work that has taken its place among those of Liddell Hart, J.F.C. Fuller and Chester Wilmot as essential reading for anyone interested in the military aspects of the war in Europe.</p><p>When Sam Donaldson interviewed General Norman Schwarzkopf in his quarters in the Gulf, PANZER BATTLES was one of the books on his desk. A model military history, this is one of the few close looks we will ever have of the tactics, the planning, and the operations of tank warfare from a participant. <br>It was the decisive victories of the German Panzer divisions in North Africa in World War II that taught the Allies the importance of an integrated combat team consisting of tanks, infantry, and artillery. PANZER BATTLES is a vivid account of the major campaigns of that war, especially the legendary desert battles fought by Rommel, who found the desert to be the perfect terrain in which to wage almost purely theoretical armored warfare with large-scale tank formations. <br>Here is an unparalleled look at what the American military learned from the experience of fighting in WWII -- experience that was put to use in the Gulf War.F.W. VON MELLENTHIN began his military career at the age of nineteen when he enlisted in the Seventh Cavalry Regiment of the German Army. He was ordered to the War Academy in 1935, was serving as intelligence officer to the 3rd Corps when the war began in 1939, and had been promoted to major general by 1945 when he was taken prisoner by American troops on the Western front</p><h2>On Golden Pond. (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>A comedy for a cast of 3 men, 2 women, 1 boy. This is the love story of Ethel and Norman Thayer, who are returning to their summer home on Golden Pond for the forty-eighth year. He is a retired professor, nearing eighty, with heart palpitations and a failing memory-but still as tart-tongued, observant and eager for life as ever. Ethel, ten years younger, and the perfect foil for Norman, delights in all the small things that have enriched and continue to enrich their long life together. They are visited by their divorced, middle-aged daughter and her dentist fianc�, who then go off to Europe, leaving his teenage son behind for the summer. The boy quickly becomes the &#34;grandchild&#34; the elderly couple have longed for, and as Norman revels in taking his ward fishing and thrusting good books at him, he also learns some lessons about modern teenage awareness-and slang-in return. In the end, as the summer wanes, so does their brief idyll, and in the final, deeply moving moments of the play, Norman and Ethel are brought even closer together by the incidence of a mild heart attack. Time, they know, is now against them, but the years have been good and, perhaps, another summer on Golden Pond still awaits.</p><p></p><h2>South With Endurance (TS) HBK</h2><p>THE DEFINITIVE AND SPELLBINDING RECORD OF SHACKLETON&#39;S LEGENDARY ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION, IMMORTALIZED ON FILM BY PIONEERING PHOTOGRAPHER FRANK HURLEY Sir Ernest Shackleton&#39;s trans-Antarctic expedition of 1914-1917 was one of the great feats of human endurance -- one vividly captured in the powerful and dramatic pictures taken by Frank Hurley, the expedition&#39;s official photographer. These images, appearing together here for the first time in print, constitute an amazing body of photojournalism created under the most adverse circumstances imaginable. As this book reveals, however, they are far more than visual reportage; they also are images of great artistry that capture the life-and-death drama that was played out against an arctic landscape of magnificent and terrible beauty. The story told here through Frank Hurley&#39;s lens began in the summer of 1914, when Shackleton and his crew set sail from England with the intention of being the first to cross Antarctica from one coast to the other, passing through the South Pole on the way. After five months they reached the freezing Weddell Sea and were within sight of land when the Endurance became trapped in the ice pack. Nine months later, the ship was finally crushed, leaving the crew stranded on drifting ice floes at the end of the earth. What followed is one of the most remarkable survival stories in the history of human exploration. Shackleton&#39;s men camped on the ice floes for five months before they escaped in their lifeboats and, after a harrowing five-day voyage, reached Elephant Island, a barren outcrop too remote for any hope of rescue. From there, Shackleton and five other volunteers set out for South Georgia Island andmiraculously reached their destination after traversing 850 miles of the fiercest seas on the face of the planet in an open lifeboat. There they raised help, and three months later, after three failed attempts, Shackleton made it back to Elephant Island with a rescue ship. Incredibly, every single one of his men survived. Almost as incredible is the fact that so much of this drama was captured on film by Frank Hurley, and that so many of these pictures survived. South with Endurance is the first book to reproduce a total of nearly 500 extant photographs, including many remarkable color images that have never been published before. It is also the first to reproduce the photos to a standard and size that display Hurley&#39;s work as the art that it is. Drawn from the archives of the Royal Geographical Society in London, the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney, and the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, the photographs are complemented by excerpts from Hurley&#39;s diary, a chapter about the expedition itself, a biographical essay, and commentary about Hurley&#39;s photographic techniques.</p><p>The story of Sir Earnest Shackleton's harrowing 1914 Antarctic expedition has been told many times in Shackleton's own account, in a PBS series and in a recent book focusing on the leadership lessons his journey taught, just to name a few. But in South with Endurance: Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition 1914-1917, The Photographs of Frank Hurley, an oversized collection featuring all of the official photographer's pictures (including several previously unpublished color plates), the voyage continues to enthrall. The stark black and white images of the ship and its men caught in an ocean of ice are both beautiful and chilling; photography buffs and adventure lovers alike will relish the images from one who was surely one of history's greatest documentary photographers. 500 photos in duotone and color. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Worship of the American Puritans</h2><p>This is the companion volume to The Worship of the English Puritans, and was first published in 1990 by Peter Lang Publishing.

There were ten in which the declines averaged 49.4%. In those, investors lost half of their invested assets. Yet, in the upside of every cycle, the endurance of the bull market transports investors into a state of confidence where they believe this time will be different. The record-breaking bull market of the 1990s certainly has had that effect, the excitement enticing investors into the market as never before, carrying them away on a euphoric wave of confidence that they've discovered something new, a risk-free money machine. <p>History shows otherwise. Eighty percent of public investors wind up losing money in the stock market over the long term, because few emerge financially intact from the periodic bear markets. <i>Riding the Bear</i> is aimed at ending that vicious cycle for its readers. It explains clearly why bear markets are inevitable, why the next one is just around the corner, and will be the longest and most severe since 1929. </p><p>But <i>Riding the Bear</i> is not just about bear markets. Readers learn how to maximize profits in a bull market, and unlike buy and hold investors, keep those profits, and go on to make more in bear markets. It introduces a simple, mechanical system, discovered during the research, that over the last 35 years would have almost tripled the gain of a buy and hold strategy, and with half the risk. It should work for the next 35 years. </p><p><i>Riding the Bear</i> also reveals the truth about Wall Street, its misleading propaganda and deceptions, and teaches its readers to be street smart. As subscribers to Sy Harding's <i>Street Smart Report</i> have come to expect, <i>Riding the Bear</i> tells it like it is, in plain English. Just two chapters "Public Investors versus Wall Street" and "What Causes Bear Markets" are more than worth the price.</p></p><p>Thanks to the exciting bull market of the 1990s, there are now more than 40 million investors in the U.S., and they have far and away more money, and a higher percentage of their net worth at risk in the market than ever before in history. Unfortunately, 85% of that money flowed into the market in just the last five years, and so has never experienced a bear market or anything like a bear market. Most of those new investors are not only unprepared, but are unaware of what they will inevitably face at some point, sooner rather than later. I fear for them. And I despair in the knowledge that a book by an unknown author will reach so relatively few of them. I hope readers will help spread the word of its value. Shakespeare or a John Grisham novel it is not. But honest, outspoken, and unafraid to tromp on Wall Street's self-serving propaganda it is. <i>Riding the Bear</i> will be a virtual life jacket for those it reaches.Sy Harding is the founder and president of Asset Management Research Corp., which has been providing stock market research to institutions and serious investors for 12 years.

Taylor's unforgettable novels she recounts "not only the joy of growing up in a large and supportive family, but my own feelings of being faced with segregation and bigotry." Her Newbery Medal-winning <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i> tells the story of one African American family, fighting to stay together and strong in the face of brutal racist attacks, illness, poverty, and betrayal in the Deep South of the 1930s. Nine-year-old Cassie Logan, growing up protected by her loving family, has never had reason to suspect that any white person could consider her inferior or wish her harm. But during the course of one devastating year when her community begins to be ripped apart by angry night riders threatening African Americans, she and her three brothers come to understand why the land they own means so much to their Papa. "Look out there, Cassie girl. All that belongs to you. You ain't never had to live on nobody's place but your own and long as I live and the family survives, you'll never have to. That's important. You may not understand that now but one day you will.

Much of what makes civilization had already existed for thousands of years in Egypt and in Mesopotamia, and had spread thence to neighbouring countries. But certain elements had been lacking until the Greeks supplied them. What they achieved in art and literature is familiar to everybody, but what they did in the purely intellectual realm is even more exceptional. They invented mathematics and science and philosophy; they first wrote history as opposed to mere annals; they speculated freely about the nature of the world and the ends of life, without being bound in the fetters of any inherited orthodoxy. What occurred was so astonishing that, until very recent times, men were content to gape and talk mystically about the Greek genius. It is possible, however, to understand the development of Greece in scientific terms, and it is well worth while to do so.<br><br>Philosophy begins with Thales, who, fortunately, can be dated by the fact that he predicted an eclipse which, according to the astronomers, occurred in the year 585 B.C. Philosophy and science -- which were not originally separate -- were therefore born together at the beginning of the sixth century. What had been happening in Greece and neighbouring countries before this time? Any answer must be in part conjectural, but archeology, during the present century, has given us much more knowledge than was possessed by our grandfathers.<br><br>The art of writing was invented in Egypt about the year 4000 B.C., and in Babylonia not much later. In each country writing began with pictures of the objects intended. These pictures quickly became conventionalized, so that words were represented by ideograms, as they still are in China. In the course of thousands of years, this cumbrous system developed into alphabetic writing.<br><br>The early development of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia was due to the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, which made agriculture very easy and very productive. The civilization was in many ways similar to that which the Spaniards found in Mexico and Peru. There was a divine king, with despotic powers; in Egypt, he owned all the land. There was a polytheistic religion, with a supreme god to whom the king had a specially intimate relation. There was a military aristocracy, and also a priestly aristocracy. The latter was often able to encroach on the royal power, if the king was weak or if he was engaged in a difficult war. The cultivators of the soil were serfs, belonging to the king, the aristocracy, or the priesthood.<br><br>There was a considerable difference between Egyptian and Babylonian theology. The Egyptians were preoccupied with death, and believed that the souls of the dead descend into the underworld, where they are judged by Osiris according to the manner of their life on earth. They thought that the soul would ultimately return to the body; this led to mummification and to the construction of splendid tombs. The pyramids were built by various kings at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. and the beginning of the third. After this time, Egyptian civilization became more and more stereotyped, and religious conservatism made progress impossible. About 1800 B.C. Egypt was conquered by Semites named Hyksos, who ruled the country for about two centuries. They left no permanent mark on Egypt, but their presence there must have helped to spread Egyptian civilization in Syria and Palestine.<br><br>Babylonia had a more warlike development than Egypt. At first, the ruling race were not Semites, but "Sumerians," whose origin is unknown. They invented cuneiform writing, which the conquering Semites took over from them. There was a period when there were various independent cities which fought with each other, but in the end Babylon became supreme and established an empire. The gods of other cities became subordinate, and Marduk, the god of Babylon, acquired a position like that later held by Zeus in the Greek pantheon. The same sort of thing had happened in Egypt, but at a much earlier time.<br><br>The religions of Egypt and Babylonia, like other ancient religions, were originally fertility cults. The earth was female, the sun male. The bull was usually regarded as an embodiment of male fertility, and bull-gods were common. In Babylon, Ishtar, the earth-goddess, was supreme among female divinities. Throughout western Asia, the Great Mother was worshipped under various names. When Greek colonists in Asia Minor found temples to her, they named her Artemis and took over the existing cult. This is the origin of "Diana of the Ephesians." Christianity transformed her into the Virgin Mary, and it was a Council at Ephesus that legitimated the title "Mother of God" as applied to Our Lady.<br><br>Where a religion was bound up with the government of an empire, political motives did much to transform its primitive features. A god or goddess became associated with the State, and had to give, not only an abundant harvest, but victory in war. A rich priestly caste elaborated the ritual and the theology, and fitted together into a pantheon the several divinities of the component parts of the empire.<br><br>Through association with government, the gods also became associated with morality. Lawgivers received their codes from a god; thus a breach of the law became an impiety. The oldest legal code still known is that of Hammurabi, king of Babylon, about 2100 B.C.; this code was asserted by the king to have been delivered to him by Marduk. The connection between religion and morality became continually closer throughout ancient times.<br><br>Babylonian religion, unlike that of Egypt, was more concerned with prosperity in this world than with happiness in the next. Magic, divination, and astrology, though not peculiar to Babylonia, were more developed there than elsewhere, and it was chiefly through Babylon that they acquired their hold on later antiquity. From Babylon come some things that belong to science: the division of the day into twenty-four hours, and of the circle into 360 degrees; also the discovery of a cycle in eclipses, which enabled lunar eclipses to be predicted with certainty, and solar eclipses with some probability. This Babylonian knowledge, as we shall see, was acquired by Thales.<br><br>The civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia were agricultural, and those of surrounding nations, at first, were pastoral. A new element came with the development of commerce, which was at first almost entirely maritime. Weapons, until about 1000 B.C., were made of bronze, and nations which did not have the necessary metals on their own territory were obliged to obtain them by trade or piracy. Piracy was a temporary expedient, and where social and political conditions were fairly stable, commerce was found to be more profitable. In commerce, the island of Crete seems to have been the pioneer. For about eleven centuries, say from 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C., an artistically advanced culture, called the Minoan, existed in Crete. What survives of Cretan art gives an impression of cheerfulness and almost decadent luxury, very different from the terrifying gloom of Egyptian temples.<br><br>Of this important civilization almost nothing was known until the excavations of Sir Arthur Evans and others. It was a maritime civilization, in close touch with Egypt (except during the time of the Hyksos). From Egyptian pictures it is evident that the very considerable commerce between Egypt and Crete was carried on by Cretan sailors; this commerce reached its maximum about 1500 B.C. The Cretan religion appears to have had many affinities with the religions of Syria and Asia Minor, but in art there was more affinity with Egypt, though Cretan art was very original and amazingly full of life. The centre of the Cretan civilization was the so-called "palace of Minos" at Knossos, of which memories lingered in the traditions of classical Greece. The palaces of Crete were very magnificent, but were destroyed about the end of the fourteenth century B.C., probably by invaders from Greece. The chronology of Cretan history is derived from Egyptian objects found in Crete, and Cretan objects found in Egypt; throughout, our knowledge is dependent on archeological evidence.<br><br>The Cretans worshipped a goddess, or perhaps several goddesses. The most indubitable goddess was the "Mistress of Animals," who was a huntress, and probably the source of the classical Artemis. She or another was also a mother; the only male deity, apart from the "Master of Animals," is her young son. There is some evidence of belief in an after life, in which, as in Egyptian belief, deeds on earth receive reward or retribution. But on the whole the Cretans appear, from their art, to have been cheerful people, not much oppressed by gloomy superstitions. They were fond of bull-fights, at which female as well as male toreadors performed amazing acrobatic feats. The bull-fights were religious celebrations, and Sir Arthur Evans thinks that the performers belonged to the highest nobility. The surviving pictures are full of movement and realism.<br><br>The Cretans had a linear script, but it has not been deciphered. At home they were peaceful, and their cities were unwalled; no doubt they were defended by sea power.<br><br>Before the destruction of the Minoan culture, it spread, about 1600 B.C., to the mainland of Greece, where it survived, through gradual stages of degeneration, until about 900 B.C. This mainland civilization is called the Mycenaean; it is known through the tombs of kings, and also through fortresses on hill- tops, which show more fear of war than had existed in Crete. Both tombs and fortresses remained to impress the imagination of classical Greece. The older art products in the palaces are either actually of Cretan workmanship, or closely akin to those of Crete. The Mycenaean civilization, seen through a haze of legend, is that which is depicted in Homer.<br><br>There is much uncertainty concerning the Mycenaeans. Did they owe their civilization to being conquered by the Cretans? Did they speak Greek, or were they an earlier indigenous race? No certain answer to these questions is possible, but on the whole it seems probable that they were conquerors who spoke Greek, and that at least the aristocracy consisted of fair-haired invaders from the North, who brought the Greek language with them. The Greeks came to Greece in three successive waves, first the Ionians, then the Achaeans, and last the Dorians. The Ionians appear, though conquerors, to have adopted the Cretan civilization pretty completely, as, later, the Romans adopted the civilization of Greece. But the Ionians were disturbed, and largely dispossessed, by their successors the Achaeans. The Achaeans are known, from the Hittite tablets found at Boghaz-Keul, to have had a large organized empire in the fourteenth century B.C. The Mycenaean civilization, which had been weakened by the warfare of the Ionians and Achaeans, was practically destroyed by the Dorians, the last Greek invaders. Whereas previous invaders had largely adopted the Minoan religion, the Dorians retained the original Indo-European religion of their ancestors. The religion of Mycenaean times, however, lingered on, especially in the lower classes, and the religion of classical Greece was a blend of the two.<br><br>Although the above account seems probable, it must be remembered that we do not <i>know</i> whether the Mycenaeans were Greeks or not. What we do know is that their civilization decayed, that about the time when it ended iron superseded bronze, and that for some time sea supremacy passed to the Phoenicians.<br><br>Both during the later part of the Mycenaean age and after its end, some of the invaders settled down and became agriculturists, while some pushed on, first into the islands and Asia Minor, then into Sicily and southern Italy, where they founded cities that lived by maritime commerce. It was in these maritime cities that the Greeks first made qualitatively new contributions to civilization; the supremacy of Athens came later, and was equally associated, when it came, with naval power.<br><br>The mainland of Greece is mountainous and largely infertile. But there are many fertile valleys, with easy access to the sea, but cut off by the mountains from easy land communication with each other. In these valleys little separate communities grew up, living by agriculture, and centering round a town, generally close to the sea. In such circumstances it was natural that, as soon as the population of any community grew too great for its internal resources, those who could not live on the land should take to seafaring. The cities of the mainland founded colonies, often in places where it was much easier to find subsistence than it had been at home. Thus in the earliest historical period the Greeks of Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy were much richer than those of the Greek mainland.<br><br>The social system was very different in different parts of Greece. In Sparta, a small aristocracy subsisted on the labour of oppressed serfs of a different race; in the poorer agricultural regions, the population consisted mainly of farmers cultivating their own land with the help of their families. But where commerce and industry flourished, the free citizens grew rich by the employment of slaves -- male in the mines, female in the textile industry. These slaves were, in Ionia, of the surrounding barbarian population, and were, as a rule, first acquired in war. With increasing wealth went increasing isolation of respectable women, who in later times had little part in the civilized aspects of Greek life except in Sparta.<br><br>There was a very general development, first from monarchy to aristocracy, then to an alternation of tyranny and democracy. The kings were not absolute, like those of Egypt and Babylonia; they were advised by a Council of Elders, and could not transgress custom with impunity. "Tyranny" did not mean necessarily bad government, but only the rule of a man whose claim to power was not hereditary. "Democracy" meant government by all the citizens, among whom slaves and women were not included. The early tyrants, like the Medici, acquired their power through being the richest members of their respective plutocracies. Often the source of their wealth was the ownership of gold and silver mines, made the more profitable by the new institution of coinage, which came from the kingdom of Lydia, adjacent to Ionia. Coinage seems to have been invented shortly before 700 B.C.<br><br>One of the most important results, to the Greeks, of commerce or piracy -- at first the two are scarcely distinct -- was the acquisition of the art of writing. Although writing had existed for thousands of years in Egypt and Babylonia, and the Minoan Cretans had a script (which has not been deciphered), there is no conclusive evidence that the Greeks knew how to write until about the tenth century B.C. They learnt the art from the Phoenicians, who, like the other inhabitants of Syria, were exposed to both Egyptian and Babylonian influences, and who held the supremacy in maritime commerce until the rise of the Greek cities of Ionia, Italy, and Sicily. In the fourteenth century, writing to Ikhnaton (the heretic king of Egypt), Syrians still used the Babylonian cuneiform; but Hiram of Tyre (969-936) used the Phoenician alphabet, which probably developed out of the Egyptian script. The Egyptians used, at first, a pure picture writing; gradually the pictures, much conventionalized, came to represent syllables (the first syllables of the names of the things pictured), and at last single letters, on the principle of "A was an Archer who shot at a frog."

Taking a scientific concept, mixing it with a super hero who can shrink to the size of an atom, adding fantastic graphics, writing that is easy to understand, and then putting it together in a 32-page book that is reader friendly. This book is written in graphic format that is a favorite of mine! It makes it perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own. Young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on will also enjoy the graphics and fast paced text. The full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. Red boxes with pertinent vocabulary words and meanings are included throughout the book. Vocabulary has been well selected and this book is an excellent resource that could be used for writing a summary, a book report, or a source for research.

Working with Gabriel Walsh, a fiendishly successful criminal lawyer with links to the town, she discovered the truth about her parents' crimes in an investigation that also revealed the darker forces at work in the place that had offered her a haven. As if that wasn't enough, she also found out that she, Gabriel and her biker boyfriend Ricky were not caught in an ordinary sort of love triangle, but were hereditary actors in an ancient drama in which the elders of Cainsville and the mysterious Huntsmen who opposed them had a huge stake.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now someone is killing street kids in the city, and the police have tied Ricky to the crimes. Setting out with Gabriel's help to clear Ricky's name, Olivia once again finds her own life at risk. Soon the three are tangled in a web of betrayals that threatens their uneasy equilibrium and is pushing them toward a hard choice: either they fulfill their destinies by trusting each other and staying true to their real bonds, or they succumb to the extraordinary forces trying to win an eternal war by tearing them apart.</p><p>KELLEY ARMSTRONG is the internationally bestselling author of the thirteen-book Women of the Otherworld series, the Nadia Stafford crime novels and her new series set in the fictional town of Cainsville, Illinois, which so far includes the novels <i>Omens</i>, <i>Visions </i>and <i>Deceptions</i>.

Its roots date back to an international conference on Shakespeare and kabuki with the theme &#39;Traditions of Cross-dressing and Cross-gender Casting&#39;, held near Kobe, Japan, in August 1995. In January of that year Kobe had suffered a major earthquake resulting in significant loss of life and great damage to the infrastructure. At last, it is now possible to publish most of the papers that were presented at the Kobe conference (together with some additional contributions), which have been edited, and where necessary, revised for publication; and though so long delayed, the essays continue to represent key areas of research by some of the world&#39;s most distinguished scholars in their fields. The topics addressed include feminism, transvestism, cross-dressing, cross-gender casting, Elizabethan boy actors and kabuki onnagata. Importantly, the volume also contains a full transcription of the Open Forum session which concluded the conference, providing the reader with a quality debate on the main issues.

A professor at the University of Texas Medical Center in Dallas, she lives in Dallas, Texas.<p> <b>From Chapter One: ARE YOU A PERFECTIONIST?</b> </p><p> Susan had been working frantically for the last month trying to get her end-of-the-year books in order, keep the business running, and plan a New Year's Eve party for her friends and her clients. A few of her friends who have been supportive of Susan's interior design business were going to bring along some potential clients. Susan's home is a reflection of her talent as a designer, so she wanted to make some changes to the formal dining room before the party that she thought would be particularly impressive. It all came together in time for the party and the evening seemed to be going well, until her assistant, Charles, asked her if Mrs. Beale and Mr. Sandoval, two important clients, had arrived. Mrs. Beale had a small antique shop in town and had referred Susan a lot of business over the past two years. Mr. Sandoval was a member of the local Chamber of Commerce and had shown interest in Susan's business. </p><p> Susan felt like her head was about to explode when she realized that she had forgotten to invite them to the party. </p><p> "Oh no, I completely forgot. How could I be so stupid? What am I going to do? They'll no doubt hear about it from someone and will assume I omitted them on purpose. I am such an idiot. I may as well kiss the business good-bye. When the word gets out, no one will want to refer to me again." </p><p> "Susan, don't you think you may be overreacting a little." Charles tried to be supportive, but deep down inside he was glad he hadn't been the one to make such an awful mistake. </p><p> For the rest of the night she held her breath waiting for her other clients to ask about Mrs. Beale and Mr. Sandoval. What would she say? That she was a thoughtless numbskull who neglected to invite a former client who referred a substantial amount of business to her each year? Even worse, what will she say when Mrs. Beale and Mr. Sandoval confront her with her rudeness. Ten different excuses ran through her mind, but she ultimately chose to avoid them and their wrath. </p><p> Susan is an inwardly focused perfectionist. Although it can help her in her work, it also hurts her when she is hard on herself and finds error completely unacceptable. Like many people, she worries about what others will think of her and her business. However, in Susan's case her errors lead to humiliation, distress, sleepless nights, and withdrawal from others. She has trouble letting go and forgiving herself because, in her mind, it is OK for others to make mistakes, but it is not OK for her to make mistakes. This book was written to help people like Susan stop beating themselves up and, instead, make the most of their skills as a perfectionist. </p><p> Tom is an outwardly focused perfectionist. He feels OK about himself, but he is often disappointed in and frustrated with others who seem to always let him down. Quality control is his line of work, but he cannot always turn it off when he leaves the office. Tom drove into his garage to find that there was still a mess on the workbench and floor that his son, Tommy, had left two days ago. </p><p> He walked through the door and said to his wife in an annoyed tone of voice, "I told Tommy to clean up his mess in the garage before I got home." </p><p> "He just got home himself a few minutes ago," his wife defended. </p><p> "Where is he now? He better not be on the phone." Tom went to his son's room only to find Tommy on the phone with his girlfriend. Tom could feel himself tensing up. "Get off the phone and go clean up that mess in the garage like I told you." </p><p> "Yes, sir." Tommy got off the phone, knowing that a lecture was coming. </p><p> Tom cannot understand why his son cannot follow simple instructions. It seems like every day there is something new. He doesn't listen, his wife doesn't take care of things on time, and the burden usually falls on him. There is always an excuse. Even when they do their parts it usually isn't good enough and they don't seem to care. It is so frustrating for Tom sometimes that he does the job himself rather than ask for help, just so he doesn't have to deal with their procrastination and excuses. </p><p> Tom's type of perfectionism causes him problems in his relationships with others because he is frequently frustrated by their failure to meet his expectations. When he tries to point this out in a gentle way, it still seems to lead to tension, and sometimes to conflict. He has tried to train himself to expect nothing from others, but that strategy doesn't seem to work either. He needs some new ideas for coping with his frustration and for how to deal with the people in his life who seem to continually let him down. </p><p> This book will help you to identify, evaluate, and change the underlying beliefs that affect your management of stressful events and your interactions with others, particularly those who leave you thinking that either you or they are not good enough. The first goal will be to gain a better understanding of how thinking that things or that you are not good enough are related to difficulties you may have at home, on the job, or in relationships. By following along in this first chapter and completing the self-assessment at the end you will determine the degree to which you are a perfectionist and in what ways it is most likely to affect your life. You will find out if you are a more inwardly focused perfectionist like Susan or a more outwardly focused perfectionist like Tom. Because perfectionism can be a very positive trait, you will need to identify the situations or circumstances in which it serves you well in addition to those situations in which it seems to hurt you. Accomplishing this second goal will help focus your attention on learning new ways to cope with times when perfectionism seems to be getting in the way or causing you distress. </p><p> The third goal of this book is to teach you to identify times when your perfectionistic beliefs about yourself or others may be inaccurate or distorted in some way and how to straighten out the distortions. If you have a more accurate view of yourself and your world you will be less prone to the emotional upset caused by those distortions. One such belief is the notion that you <i>have to</i> be perfect or that others <i>have to</i> be perfect. </p><p> One of the common problems faced by both kinds of perfectionists is having expectations that are too high or that are difficult to achieve without considerable wear and tear on you and on others. The fourth goal of this book is to help you to determine if your expectations are too high, how close you are to achieving your goals, and what you will need to do to reach a more satisfying level. </p><p> Much of the stress that leaves you thinking that you or others are not good enough results from your interactions with other people. It is often difficult to pinpoint the cause of these tensions and to determine what to do about them. Therefore, the fifth and final goal of this book is to help you deal more effectively with other people. Some guidelines are provided on how to manage situations with others that are often difficult, discouraging, or conflictual. Some helpful hints have also been included for the people in your life who want to learn how to interact with you in a way that does not leave you with the sense that you are not good enough. </p><p> These methods are based on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), a scientifically proven effective treatment for many of the psychological difficulties associated with perfectionism. Starting first with education about perfectionism, then working through the cognitive-behavioral methods for controlling the distress associated with perfection, you will gain a more accurate view of yourself and of others. You will learn what it means to be good enough, see how close you really are to achieving your goals, and reduce the emotional pain associated with seeing yourself and others as not good enough. </p><p> <br> <b>THE P</b></p></p><h2>My John 3:16 Book: Lola Mazola&#39;s Happyland Adventure</h2><p>No ordinary children&#x2019;s tale, <i><b>My John 3:16 Book</b></i> gives children&#x2019;s ministry leaders, Sunday school teachers, and parents a very special do-it-yourself way of leading kids to Christ through the doorway of the Bible&#x2019;s most beloved promise passage. &nbsp;The adorable title character learns the meaning and truth of John 3:16 in relation to her desperate desire to visit the Happyland theme park.

Thousands of books and articles cover nearly every aspect of the battle, but not a single volume focuses on the military aspects of the monumentally important movements of the armies to and across the Potomac River. One Continuous Fight: The Retreat from Gettysburg and the Pursuit of Lee&#x2019;s Army of Northern Virginia, July 4-14, 1863 is the first detailed military history of Lee&#x2019;s retreat and the Union effort to catch and destroy the wounded Army of Northern Virginia.<br> Against steep odds and encumbered with thousands of casualties, Confederate commander Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s post-battle task was to successfully withdraw his army across the Potomac River. Union commander George G. Meade&#x2019;s equally difficult assignment was to intercept the effort and destroy his enemy. The responsibility for defending the exposed Southern columns belonged to cavalry chieftain James Ewell Brown (Jeb) Stuart. If Stuart fumbled his famous ride north to Gettysburg, his generalship during the retreat more than redeemed his flagging reputation.<br> The ten days of retreat triggered nearly two dozen skirmishes and major engagements, including fighting at Granite Hill, Monterey Pass, Hagerstown, Williamsport, Funkstown, Boonsboro, and Falling Waters. President Abraham Lincoln was thankful for the early July battlefield victory, but disappointed that General Meade was unable to surround and crush the Confederates before they found safety on the far side of the Potomac. Exactly what Meade did to try to intercept the fleeing Confederates, and how the Southerners managed to defend their army and ponderous 17-mile long wagon train of wounded until crossing into western Virginia on the early morning of July 14, is the subject of this study <br> One Continuous Fight draws upon a massive array of documents, letters, diaries, newspaper accounts, and published primary and secondary sources. These long-ignored foundational sources allow the authors, each widely known for their expertise in Civil War cavalry operations, to describe carefully each engagement. The result is a rich and comprehensive study loaded with incisive tactical commentary, new perspectives on the strategic role of the Southern and Northern cavalry, and fresh insights on every engagement, large and small, fought during the retreat.<br> The retreat from Gettysburg was so punctuated with fighting that a soldier felt compelled to describe it as &#x201c;One Continuous Fight.&#x201d; Until now, few students fully realized the accuracy of that description. Complimented with 18 original maps, dozens of photos, and a complete driving tour with GPS coordinates of the entire retreat, One Continuous Fight is an essential book for every student of the American Civil War in general, and for the student of Gettysburg in particular.<br> About the Authors: Eric J.

In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love - and all of love's nasty fallout - anyway. <br><br> But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core - not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean - and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it. <br><br> Told in Stella's own exuberant, dead-on, dead honest voice, How Stella Got Her Groove Back is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life - and what she must risk to do it.</p><p>The author of <i>Waiting to Exhale</i> checks in again with a fresh, exuberant novel. Stella Payne is a Superwoman who has everything--except a man to rock her world, something she's convinced she can well do without. On a spur-of-the-moment Jamaican vacation she meets Winston, a man half her age, and finds, to her dismay, that her world is indeed well and truly rocked. Stella soon realizes that she's come to a cataclysmic juncture in her life, one that forces new and difficult questions about her passions and expectations.Terry McMillan is the critically acclaimed, award-winning author of five previous novels and recipient of the Essence Award for Excellence in Literature. <br><br> <p> </p> <p> </p></p><h2>Picture Me Cute As Can Bee</h2><p>Baby is as cute as can be when you insert his or her photo inside this exciting new title from Picture Me Books.</p><p></p><h2>Alan Turing: The Enigma: The Book That Inspired the Film The Imitation Game</h2><p><b>The official book behind the film, <i>The Imitation Game</i>, this is a dramatic portrayal of the life and work of Alan Turing, one of Britain's most extraordinary unsung heroes, and one of the world's greatest innovators.</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the official story that has inspired the British film, <i>The Imitation Game,</i> a nail-biting race against time following Alan Turing, the pioneer of modern-day computing and credited with cracking the German Enigma code, and his brilliant team at Britain's top-secret code-breaking centre, Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. Turing, whose contributions and genius significantly shortened the war, saving thousands of lives, was the eventual victim of an unenlightened British establishment, but his work and legacy live on.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister Gordon Brown released a statement of apology in 2009 on behalf of the British government for the "appalling" treatment of Turing.</p><p>Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges:<p> </p><blockquote>Alan had proved that there was no "miraculous machine" that could solve all mathematical problems, but in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea of a universal machine that could take over the work of <i>any</i> machine.</blockquote><p> During World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German's Enigma machine code was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security, implemented with machines and remorseless logic: "It was his own invention, and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs."</p><p> Andrew Hodges's remarkable insight weaves Turing's mathematical and computer work with his personal life to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek Jacobi movie <i>Breaking the Code</i>. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain the intellectual significance of Turing's work, while never losing sight of the human and social picture: </p><p> </p><blockquote>In this sense his life belied his work, for it could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society, the individual and history.</blockquote><p> And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but few admit, about their subjects: "his inner code remains unbroken." Alan Turing is still an enigma. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><br> <p>"One of the finest scientific biographies I've ever read: authoritative, superbly researched, deeply sympathetic, and beautifully told."<b>--Sylvia Nasar, author of <i>A Beautiful Mind</i><br> </b><br> </p><br> <p>"A captivating, compassionate portrait of a first-rate scientist who gave so much to a world that in the end cruelly rejected him.

Queen Elizabeth has been served by nine prime ministers (the first was Winston Churchill), has seen Britain decline in power, headed a Commonwealth made up of countries as far-flung and diverse as Nigeria and the Falkland Islands, and has had to cope with divorce and separations within her own, very visible, family. All this should make for a rich biography, but the queen is still the queen, and, with her advisors, closely guards her privacy--which means that Keay must rely on often unattributed gossip and old sources in telling Elizabeth's story. We do learn that the monarch is a bit of a tightwad; that she is pragmatic, has a dry sense of humor, does not forgive those who have offended her, and is not amused by the antics of her daughters-in-law. Elizabeth apparently cares tremendously about the Commonwealth, which ``she sees almost in sentimental terms as a family of nations which offers the rest of the world an example of informal unity,'' and she is considered to have influenced Margaret Thatcher to expedite independence for Zimbabwe. Elizabeth's long reign, Keay says, has given her an unequalled continuity of experience that she draws on in weekly meetings with the prime minister, whom legally she can only advise, encourage, and warn. It is unlikely, the author argues, that she will abdicate in favor of Prince Charles. Keay concludes that, despite some rocky times, the Royal Family is now as much a beloved national treasure as an invaluable institution of governance. More anecdotal than analytical, and written in less-than- sparkling prose: for hard-core royalty fans only. (Sixteen-page photo insert--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>British journalist Keay portrays Queen Elizabeth II as a vibrant human being rather than merely a personage in a singular situation. He draws on interviews with Prince Philip and Prince Charles, along with household staff members and other insiders, to tell the lively story. Richly detailed descriptions recall 1937, when shy, 11-year-old "Princess Lilibet" began to prepare herself for the throne she would inherit in 1952 from her father, George VI. Covering events during the queen's reign--40 years of joys and trials--Keay shows contradictory sides of the private woman: enormously wealthy, she is notoriously stingy; considered dully unresponsive, Elizabeth is quietly witty. But above all, the book reveals an admirable character who never shirks her duties. Readers will empathize with Elizabeth II, who, amid family embarrassments and public criticisms, continues to occupy the throne with dignity and composure.

The projects include tables, desks, cabinets, boxes and chests.&#39;</p><p>English woodworker Howard turned his hobby into a livelihood and now retails his work through fine furniture catalogs. His first book contains detailed instructions for the construction of 18 pieces, fine reproductions all. He begins with a chapter each on materials and techniques, construction, and finishing and then presents projects in a random fashion rather than in order of increasing difficulty. Well presented graphically, with both color and black-and-white photography, the projects progress through both outline and specific instructions, with numerous tips, tricks, and "insider" anecdotes. The materials lists exclude fastening materials, though, and Howard uses some techniques beyond the comfort or knowledge of some neophytes.

Many parents who were radically impacted by Lee Strobel&#39;s spiritual journey from atheism to Christianity wanted a student-friendly edition to help their teenagers find Christ or deepen their faith. The Case for Christ--Student Edition is the response to this need: a highly readable, thoroughly engaging, and spiritually challenging version designed both for teenagers who are Christians and those seeking the truth about Jesus. This is not a watered-down version of the original book, but an entirely fresh approach to the same subject matter--with brand new material. Strobel partnered with Jane Vogel, a writer highly regarded for her ability to communicate with students, to customize the content of his book for a post-modern mindset. They&#39;ve redefined courage in evangelism and moved it away from confronting someone about your faith to letting someone get close enough to you to see why you need Jesus&#39; salvation. This creative and fast-paced book follows Strobel, an investigative reporter, on email interviews as he unearths convincing evidence that faith in Jesus Christ of Nazareth is not based on wishful thinking or fabricated legends, but on solid historical facts.</p><p>Lee Strobel is an award-winning legal editor of The Chicago Tribune and a New York Times bestselling author. After years of nonfiction bestsellers, he is publishing his debut fiction novel, a legal thriller. Lee is a Yale Law School graduate, accomplished journalist, and world-renowned speaker.

Returning to Oxford to take up a full-time post as a librarian at the city library, Jennings worked briefly at Chatto and Windus before becoming a full-time poet. Her second volume of poetry, A Way of Looking (1955), won the Somerset Maugham Award, which allowed her to travel to Rome, a city which had an immense impact on her poetry and Roman Catholic faith. While she suffered from physical and mental ill health from her early thirties, Jennings was a popular and widely read poet. She received the W.H. Smith award in 1987 for Collected Poems 1953 - 1985, and in 1992 was awarded a CBE. She died in Rosebank Care Home, Bampton, in 2001 and is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford.</p><h2>The Complete Handbook of Garden Plants</h2><p>Discusses the characteristics and cultivation of a wide variety of trees, shrubs, flowers, and other decorative plants for an outdoor garden</p><p></p><h2>Off the Record</h2><p>Judge Laurel Kincade has it all---brains, beauty, and an aristocratic Old South family to back her up.

The results provide little support to the five predictions of the self-medication hypothesis, but interesting findings emerge. In terms of drug use, weak school commitment predicts an increase in alcohol use and weak parental attachment predicts an increase in marijuana use among early and late adolescent girls. In terms of violence, high self-esteem was found to increase violent behavior among late adolescent girls, contrary to expectation.</p><p>Michael Ostrowsky has a B.A. from University of Massachusetts at Amherst, an M.A. from Florida Atlantic University, and a Ph.D. from University at Albany, SUNY.

Rutgers University Press is pleased to announce the availability of this book in two separate volumes for courses in African American history that span two semesters. Volume I includes the following chapters:</p><ul><li>Africa and the Atlantic Slave Trade</li><li>The Evolution of Slavery in British North America</li><li>Slavery and Freedom in the Age of Revolution</li><li>The Early Republic and the Rise of the Cotton Kingdom</li><li>Slavery and the Slave Community</li><li>Free People of Color and the Fight against Slavery</li><li>From Militancy to Civil War</li></ul></p><p><i>Hard Road to Freedom</i> tells the story of African America from its African roots to the political and social upheavals at the end of the twentieth century. It interweaves the experiences of individual black Americans with an analysis of the nation's pursuit of its fundamental principles, of freedom, and civil rights. The book begins with African cultures and the African people who withstood the horrors of the slave trade and slavery to help shape a new multiracial society in North America. <p>The American Revolution brought freedom to some, but most remained in the grip of slavery. African Americans and their allies continually raised the cry for freedom, building determined black communities and dedicated antislavery organizations that contributed to the abolition of slavery. The precarious freedom after the Civil War brought new opportunities, but also new dangers and the limitations of Jim Crow. The wars and the depression in the early twentieth century found black Americans forging new alliances, creating a cultural renaissance, and fighting for democracy and freedom abroad. At home, they struggled against the denials of freedom and citizenship that still barred their full participation and that tarnished America's standing in the eyes of the international community. Throughout the social and political turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s and the political and cultural backlash that followed, African Americans continued to raise their voices in often eloquent and always insistent appeals that the nation live up to the promise of its principles. </p><p>This book tells of America's unsteady advance along the road to freedom, the triumphs and hope, as well as the failures and despair, from the vantage point of the African Americans who resolutely played a critical role in that story. AUTHORBIO: James Oliver Horton, the Benjamin Banneker Professor of American Studies and History at the George Washington University, directs the Africa American Communities Project at the Smithsonian Institution. Lois E. Horton is professor of sociology and American studies at George Mason University. They are coauthors of several books, including In Hope of Liberty: Culture, Community and Protest Among Northern Free Blacks, 1700-1860 and Black Bostonians: Family Life and Community Struggle in the Antebellum North.</p><i>Hard Road to Freedom</i> is an extraordinary contribution to the literature on the African American experience. The Hortons most assuredly will be compared to such influential writers on the subject as John Hope Franklin and C. Eric Lincoln. This academic yet readable work highlights the contributions and struggles of black people in the U.S. from their arrival from Africa to the new social order of the multicultural twenty-first century. The Hortons detail the Atlantic slave trade, slavery in British North America, and slavery during the age of revolution, the early republic, and the rise of cotton. Other topics include the fight against slavery, militancy and civil war, and Reconstruction and Jim Crow. The twentieth-century political and popular issues facing African Americans discussed here include populism, industrial union, the Harlem Renaissance, postwar civil rights, civil rights and black power, and conservatism and race in multicultural America. The book ends optimistically: "blacks will continue the struggle along the hard road to freedom, justice, and equality," a point that the Hortons have proved with their careful discussion, telling illustrations, and exhaustive research. <i>Lillian Lewis</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Although they worked in different media, Auguste Rodin and Gustav Klimt were two artists whose output generated both incredible enthusiasm and virulent denunciation in their lifetimes. On the centenary of their deaths, in 1917 and 1918 respectively, this opulent volume highlights the remarkable parallels between the two creators: their passion for the human figure, erotic subject matter, pioneering techniques, and the achievement of international success. In chapters of alternating perspectives, this book features essays on fin-de-si�cle Vienna, the phenomenon of artistic celebrity, and a tribute to the two seminal works that each artist gave the same name: The Kiss. Bringing these two masters together for the first time in such a detailed manner, this book captures a significant moment in European culture and demonstrates why their geniuses still speak so profoundly to us today.</p><p>Tobias G.

During her 63 years on the throne, few have got to know her well, but there is one body of work that sheds new light on her thoughts, personality and the issues that really concern her: the Queen's own speeches.

Time to hit the books!</p><p></p></p><p>Amelia Bedelia is a housekeeper who takes her instructions quite literally. Reading the list of chores that her employer has left her, Amelia begins with "Dust the furniture." How odd, Amelia thinks to herself. "At my house we undust the furniture." Nonetheless, she dutifully locates the "Dusting Powder" in the bathroom, and proceeds to sprinkle it all over the living-room furniture and floor. Next she is asked to "Draw the drapes when the sun comes in." So of course, Amelia sits down with a sketchpad and gives it her best shot. Children love reading about the antics of silly Amelia Bedelia for myriad reasons. It's an early reader book, so children in primary grades can take satisfaction in reading the book on their own. But, even more thrilling, children who are 6 and older can successfully interpret the figurative meaning behind most adult idioms. Being told to "keep an eye on the cat," for example, might compel some preschoolers to stick their eyeballs on a cat's face, eliciting peals of laughter from know-it-all grownups. But older children know better, and they love the fact that they know better. Young readers will find this bumblingly charming, eager-to-please housekeeper as irresistible as Amelia Bedelia's employers do.

(Who Was?)</h2><p><b><b>Grab your Js and hit the court with this Who Was? biography about NBA superstar Michael Jordan.</b></b><br><br>Meet the man who changed the game forever. Michael Jordan has always been competitive--even as a young boy, he fought for attention. His need to be the best made him a star player on his college basketball team and helped him become an NBA legend, both for his skills and his endorsements. His Nike contract for Air Jordan basketball shoes set an unmatched precedent for professional athletes. Author Kirsten Anderson takes readers through each exciting moment, detailing the iconic reverse lay-ups and jump shots of Michael Jordan's storied career.</p><p>Kirsten Anderson is a freelance writer and actress who lives in New York City with her charming Pomeranian, Sunflower. She has written several biographies for children, including <i>Who Was Andy Warhol?</i> and <i>Who Was Robert Ripley?</i><b>Who Is Michael Jordan?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was less than a minute to go in the 1982 college basketball championship game, one of the biggest events in sports. The Hoyas, Georgetown University&#x2019;s men&#x2019;s basketball team, had taken a one-point lead over their rivals, the Tar Heels from the University of North Carolina. With thirty-two seconds left, Carolina coach Dean Smith called a time-out so he could discuss their next moves with his players.<br> &nbsp;<br> The team, in their white-and-blue uniforms, gathered around their coach. He knew that Georgetown would carefully guard James Worthy and Sam Perkins, two UNC players who had become big stars. Coach Smith had to decide who else could take a shot at scoring a basket if Worthy and Perkins couldn&#x2019;t get free from defenders. He thought the team should try to get the ball to Michael.<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael Jordan was a nineteen-year-old freshman at UNC in 1982. Coach Dean Smith rarely let freshmen play. He thought the first-year students needed to watch and learn&#x2014;from the bench&#x2014;before they were ready to play big-time college basketball.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Michael stood out. He was quick and could jump high. He was tough and energetic. Even better, he loved to work and to learn. He practiced hard and listened to his coaches&#x2019; instructions. Coach Smith knew he was different. He put Michael in the starting lineup for the first game of the season, and he stayed there all year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, with seconds left on the clock, Coach Smith was going to trust the team&#x2019;s chance at a championship to the freshman, Michael Jordan. Everyone knew he had the talent to make the shot. But even more importantly, Michael had the confidence. Some athletes would be scared by this big moment. They might be afraid of making a mistake. And they certainly didn&#x2019;t want to be the one to lose the game. Michael was another kind of athlete. He <i>wanted</i> to take the shot.<br> &nbsp;<br> The time-out ended and the players got ready to go back on the court. Their coach had only one thing to say: &#x201c;Knock it in, Michael.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The clock started again. The Georgetown players swarmed Worthy and Perkins. Michael waited on the other side of the court. With fifteen seconds left, Jimmy Black passed the ball to him. Michael caught it and jumped in the air. The ball left his hands and sailed sixteen feet to the basket.&nbsp; It swished in and the Tar Heels took a one-point lead. The crowd roared.<br> &nbsp;<br> Georgetown had time to make another shot, but their players couldn&#x2019;t seem to score. The clock ticked down to zero. The UNC Tar Heels were the 1982 college basketball champions!<br> &nbsp;<br> After the game, Michael told a reporter that he hadn&#x2019;t felt any pressure. It was just another jump shot.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the very first game-winning shot made by Michael Jordan. It was far from the last. He would go on to win six NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals. He was named Most Valuable Player five times and played on fourteen All-Star teams. Many people consider him the greatest basketball player ever and one of the greatest athletes of all time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Too Short</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 17, 1963. His parents, James and Deloris, were both from North Carolina. James had moved the family to New York so that he could go to school. Michael had an older brother, James, known as Ronnie, and a sister, Deloris, called Sis. Another brother, Larry, was just a year older than him. The family returned to North Carolina when Michael was five months old. His sister Roslyn was born the next year.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a family of five children, Michael wanted to be the center of attention. He danced, sang, told jokes, and played tricks. Sis said he always loved to have an audience.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jordans moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, when Michael was five so they could be closer to James&#x2019;s job at a General Electric plant. James loved baseball. He taught Michael and Larry to play as soon as they could hold a bat. Soon they were playing in Little League. As they got older, they also became interested in basketball. Their father put up a basketball hoop for the boys. And later he built a court for them.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Michael was nine, he watched the 1972 Olympic gold medal basketball game between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Americans lost. Michael told his mother, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be in the Olympics one day and I&#x2019;m going to make sure we win.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael and Larry played against each other any chance they could get. Michael adored Larry and looked up to him, but he always wanted to beat him when they played.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone agreed that Larry was a fantastic athlete. He was very strong and quick. Most people thought that Larry could have been a star basketball player. But there was one problem&#x2014;everyone expected basketball players to be tall and Larry was short.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Michael kept growing. Soon he was taller than Larry. He became an outstanding baseball player. At age twelve, he was named the state&#x2019;s most valuable player after his Little League team won the state championship.<br> &nbsp;<br> He kept getting better at basketball, too. In 1977, Michael entered the ninth grade. Every morning, he came to the gym before school to practice basketball with his friend Leroy Smith. Michael was about five feet, seven inches tall. Leroy was a whole foot taller! But Michael was fast and could jump high. They had both made the middle school team. In one game, the team scored fifty-four points. Michael scored forty-four of them!<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1978, Michael and Leroy began their sophomore year at Laney High School. They both tried out for the varsity basketball team. Leroy made it and Michael didn&#x2019;t. Later, the coaches said that they knew how good Michael was. But height is important in basketball. And the coaches felt that they needed someone tall like Leroy to compete with other teams.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Michael didn&#x2019;t know the truth. He only knew that he hadn&#x2019;t made the team. He went home and cried alone in his room. He thought about quitting, but his mother encouraged him to stick with it. Michael took her advice and played with the junior varsity team during his first year at Laney. He worked hard and put on a show, averaging twenty-eight points per game. It was obvious how talented he was on the court.<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael was worried, though. He wanted to have great skills <i>and</i> to be taller. He prayed every day. He hung from a bar, hoping to stretch himself out. By age sixteen, Michael was five feet ten. That was taller than most people in the Jordan family. It seemed unlikely he would grow much more than that.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then one day, a cousin came to visit the Jordans. He was six feet seven! Suddenly Michael had hope&#x2014;there were taller people than him in the family after all!<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael had another worry as his sophomore year wore on. He had constant pain in his knees. His doctor took X-rays of Michael&#x2019;s legs and discovered good news. The X-rays showed that he was growing fast and had a lot more growing to do. The pain was probably related to his rapid growth.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he returned to school for his junior year in the fall of 1979, Michael was six feet three and still growing. He easily made the varsity team. Michael was offered two jersey numbers. He chose twenty-three because he hoped to be half as good a player as his brother Larry who wore number forty-five.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now he had the height to match his skills. And people beyond his high school were beginning to notice.</p><h2>One Love (Marley)</h2><p><b>Based on the timeless song by Bob Marley</b><br><br><b>Now available as a board book that is perfect for toddlers and preschoolers to learn about diversity, teamwork, and love.</b><br><br><b>One love, one heart, let's get together and feel all right:</b> Adapted from one of Bob Marley's most beloved songs, <em>One Love</em> brings the joyful spirit and unforgettable lyrics to life for a new generation.

Her name is Annie Wilkes, and she is more than a rabid reader&#x2014;she is Paul&#x2019;s nurse, tending his shattered body after an automobile accident. But she is also furious that the author has killed off her favorite character in his latest book. Annie becomes his captor, keeping him prisoner in her isolated house.<br> <br>Annie wants Paul to write a book that brings Misery back to life&#x2014;just for her. She has a lot of ways to spur him on. One is a needle. Another is an axe. And if they don&#x2019;t work, she can get really nasty.<br> <br>&#x201c;Terrifying&#x201d; (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>), &#x201c;dazzlingly well-written&#x201d; (<i>The Indianapolis Star</i>), and &#x201c;truly gripping&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>), <i>Misery</i> is &#x201c;classic Stephen King...full of twists and turns and mounting suspense&#x201d; (<i>The</i> <i>Boston Globe</i>).</p><p>In <i>Misery</i> (1987), as in <i>The Shining</i> (1977), a writer is trapped in an evil house during a Colorado winter. Each novel bristles with claustrophobia, stinging insects, and the threat of a lethal explosion. Each is about a writer faced with the dominating monster of his unpredictable muse.<p> Paul Sheldon, the hero of <i>Misery</i>, sees himself as a caged parrot who must return to Africa in order to be free. Thus, in the novel within a novel, the romance novel that his mad captor-nurse, Annie Wilkes, forces him to write, he goes to Africa--a mysterious continent that evokes for him the frightening, implacable solidity of a woman's (Annie's) body. The manuscript fragments he produces tell of a great Bee Goddess, an African queen reminiscent of H. Rider Haggard's <i>She</i>.</p><p> He hates her, he fears her, he wants to kill her; but all the same he needs her power. Annie Wilkes literally breathes life into him. </p><p> <i>Misery</i> touches on several large themes: the state of possession by an evil being, the idea that art is an act in which the artist willingly becomes captive, the tortured condition of being a writer, and the fears attendant to becoming a "brand-name" bestselling author with legions of zealous fans. And yet it's a tight, highly resonant echo chamber of a book--one of King's shortest, and best novels ever. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

In novelist Marr&#x2019;s (the Wicked Lovely series) first picture book, a mother plays along, imagining her baby and herself as six different animals as she lovingly tracks its development. &#x2018;Then you whimpered and meowed, and I thought you might be a thirsty kitten,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;I offered you some milk so you would not be hungry.&#x2019; White&#x2019;s (<i>Adventures with Barefoot Critters</i>) restrained detailing, smudged colors, and frequent use of circular framings give her watercolors a vintage-looking, pastoral prettiness. It&#x2019;s also fun to see how the mother retains her essential &#x2018;momness&#x2019; regardless of what species she assumes: as a lizard, she wears green pearls and carries an over-the-shoulder bag. With its emphasis on motherly pacifying, this warmhearted story is best suited for younger readers who are still happy to consent to all the tender doting that their caretakers are willing to dish out.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A mother&#x2019;s observations of her new baby lead to a series of sweet comparisons to various animals. &#x2018;When I met you, you were small and trembling, and I thought you might be a little bunny. / I held you close so you were warm.&#x2019; Teen author Marr (<i>Made for You</i>, 2014, etc.) uses playful yet comforting language in her picture-book debut. The baby&#x2019;s squirming kicks remind her of a &#x2018;lost kangaroo&#x2019;; a lifting of the child&#x2019;s head makes her think of a &#x2018;curious lizard&#x2019;; and the little one&#x2019;s howl seems like that of a &#x2018;lonely wolf.&#x2019; Each of the child&#x2019;s behaviors leads to a tender action taken by the mother: tucking the baby in, offering milk, and giving a bath. Each time a new creature is introduced, White gently changes the dominant color in the muted pastel palette of her watercolor and gouache illustrations. That hue is also reflected in the hand-lettered text, giving the overall design of the book a vintage feel. When the baby smiles, the mother knows &#x2018;You are not a bunny-roo-lizard-wolf-kitten-piggy. You are my baby.&#x2019; The final page shows the curled-up infant asleep in a pile of blankets. A lovely package, this quiet title will be best as a gift book for new moms eager to read aloud to the newest members of their families.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Using examples from nature in which animals care for their young, a human mother describes how she cares for her own baby. She cites bunnies, who are held close; joeys, who are carried in mom&#x2019;s pouch; lizards, who enjoy a patch of warm sun; wolves, who snuggle cozily in a den; kittens, who drink milk; and piggies, who calm down after a bath. When her own baby smiles, Mom replies, &#x2018;You are not a bunny-roolizard-wolf-kitten-piggy. You are my baby.&#x2019; Marr&#x2019;s soothing text (&#x2018;When I met you, you were small and trembling, and I thought you might be a little bunny. I held you close so you were warm&#x2019;) should prove calming for lap-sitting infants just beginning to focus on illustrations. White&#x2019;s watercolor and gouache artwork exhibits a cozy feel, with realistically drawn animals posed against simple, recognizable settings.

Now, for the first time ever, he reveals what it takes to achieve total mental and physical dominance, showing you how to be relentless and achieve whatever you desire.<br> <br> Direct, blunt, and brutally honest,<b> </b>Grover breaks down what it takes to be unstoppable: you keep going when everyone else is giving up, you thrive under pressure, you never let your emotions make you weak. In &#x201c;The Relentless 13,&#x201d; he details the essential traits shared by the most intense competitors and achievers in sports, business, and all walks of life. <i>Relentless </i>shows you how to trust your instincts and get in the Zone; how to control and adapt to any situation; how to find your opponent&#x2019;s weakness and attack.

You keep pushing yourself harder when everyone else has had enough.<p></p> <br><br> <br>When you work with highly successful, high-profile people, there&#x2019;s a saying you live by or you won&#x2019;t be in that world for long: those who talk don&#x2019;t know, and those who know don&#x2019;t talk.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t talk.<br> <br>My clients have enough exposure in their lives; they have to know that what we do in their private training belongs to them. If I don&#x2019;t have their complete trust, nothing gets done.<br> <br>For that reason, little has ever been revealed about how I train my players, what goes on in the gym and everywhere else we work, and how we get the results that make the best even better.<br> <br>But if you&#x2019;re willing to take this journey into the world of intense competition and achievement, I&#x2019;m willing to talk about what I&#x2019;ve learned from working with the greats for more than two decades, how I work with my athletes and how I&#x2019;ve come to know what I know, what they&#x2019;ve taught me and what I teach them.<br> <br>I want you to be able to take all of this and use it as a framework for yourself to achieve whatever you desire. You don&#x2019;t have to worry about training like a professional athlete&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a full-time job, and anyone who says you can &#x201c;train like a pro&#x201d; by reading a book is just trying to sell you a book. The book might be a good start, but let&#x2019;s be honest: you train like a pro by committing to work at the highest level of intensity, every moment, in everything you do, constantly working on your body, your skills, your preparation, leaving no detail to chance. It&#x2019;s not something you can do for thirty minutes in the morning, then head to work or school or wherever your other obligations take you.<br> <br>But you can take an elite athlete&#x2019;s mentality and use it to succeed at whatever you do. Absolutely everything in this book can be applied equally to athletics or business or school or anything else you do in the world.<br> <br>Because no matter what you want for yourself, whether your ambitions take you to the gym or the office or anywhere else you want to be, your ultimate power source will come from the neck up, not the neck down.<br> <br>In sports, we spend so much time on the physical component&#x2014;training, working, pushing the human body to be faster and stronger and more resilient than most people ever thought possible. And then eventually, we get around to paying some peripheral attention to mental conditioning.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s completely backward. Excellence isn&#x2019;t only about hitting the gym and working up a sweat; that&#x2019;s the smallest part of what you have to do. Physical ability can only take you so far.<br> <br>The fact is, you can&#x2019;t train your body&#x2014;or excel at anything&#x2014;before you train your mind. You can&#x2019;t commit to excellence until your mind is ready to take you there. Teach the mind to train the body.<br> <br>Physical dominance can make you great. Mental dominance is what ultimately makes you unstoppable.<br> <br>You will never have a more powerful training tool than this: get your mind strong, so your body can follow. The true measure of an individual is determined by what you can&#x2019;t measure&#x2014;the intangibles. Anyone can measure weight, height, physical strength, speed . . . but you can&#x2019;t measure commitment, persistence, or the instinctive power of the muscle in your chest, your heart. That&#x2019;s where your true works begins: understanding what you want to achieve and knowing what you&#x2019;re willing to endure to get it.<br> <br>I want guys who want to work as hard as I do. I&#x2019;m going to be relentless in my own pursuit of excellence, and I expect you to do the same. It&#x2019;s my name on the work we do together, and it&#x2019;s your name on the jersey. That better mean as much to you as it does to me.<br> <br>And if you have to ask whether you can handle it, you can&#x2019;t.<br> <br>When I train my athletes, it&#x2019;s a dictatorship with three rules: show up, work hard, and listen. If you can do those three things, I can help you. If you can&#x2019;t, we have no use for each other. I will bust my ass for you every way possible, but I expect you to do the same for yourself. I&#x2019;m not going to work harder than you do for your benefit. Show me you want it, and I&#x2019;ll give it to you.<br> <br>But we have to do this my way. No disrespect to your team trainer or dad or massage therapist, but if they knew how to handle the details of your situation, or if you knew how to do it yourself, you wouldn&#x2019;t be here. What we&#x2019;re going to do together is maybe 20 percent physical, and the rest is mental. You already have the talent; my job is to show you what you can do with all that talent so you can bust out of that cage holding you back. You may not like what I tell you, but if you stay with it, you&#x2019;ll see the rewards. Without a doubt, I&#x2019;ve had plenty of players who aren&#x2019;t worth $2 million getting paid ten times that because they&#x2019;re in my program, they stick with it, and that means something to the teams. If you&#x2019;re working with me, they know you&#x2019;re serious.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;re a professional, that means you&#x2019;re managing your career and we&#x2019;re going to approach it that way. Your body is a business you have to take care of, or the business goes away, and if you forget that, believe me, I will remind you. I&#x2019;m not here to draft on your fame or your success. I expect us both to commit to hard work and dedication, and hopefully the result will be a professional relationship we can both be proud of. I see so many trainers who want to be friends with the players, trying to keep them happy for fear they&#x2019;ll lose a big-name client, going easy when the players say, &#x201c;Enough.&#x201d; Believe me when I say this: I don&#x2019;t need to be your friend. You already have plenty of friends to tell you how great you are. What you and I do together is professional, not personal. If we end up being friends, that&#x2019;s great, but it&#x2019;s more important to me that we take care of your career and your future.<br> <br>Some players like to be involved in planning what our work will entail; others are content to let me handle the details. Kobe wants to be part of figuring out what we have to do together; Michael was the same. Kobe will come to me and say something like, &#x201c;Listen, when I jump off with my left leg I&#x2019;m getting a pain in my knee.&#x201d; So I&#x2019;ll go back and retrace his steps: When did you start feeling it, what part of the game? Then I&#x2019;ll go to the video and replay everything he did, looking for something that might have affected that knee. Or was it something we did together working out? And I&#x2019;ll go through all the exercises to see if we might have aggravated something. I can say to him, &#x201c;Remember in the Utah game, during this play, when this and that happened . . . ?&#x201d; And he&#x2019;ll know what I&#x2019;m talking about, we&#x2019;ll review the situation, until I can eventually say to him with some certainty, &#x201c;I think your knee problem might have started there, and now we need to do this and that to fix it.&#x201d; Total collaboration.<br> <br>So I&#x2019;m happy to listen to your input and ideas, but once you&#x2019;re working with me, you agree to let me do what I do. No options. Most people have too many options, and they rarely choose the tougher one. Do you want to work out for ninety minutes or thirty minutes? Most people take the thirty minutes. Here, try this, but if it&#x2019;s too hard, we can make it easier. And they automatically make it easier. So I&#x2019;m not giving you options. Nothing for you to think about. Let me do all the thinking for both of us. I&#x2019;m making your life easy by doing all the homework and giving you the answers to the test. Just show up, work hard, and listen. That&#x2019;s your part of the deal. Do the work.<br> <br>Do. The. Work. Every day, you have to do something you don&#x2019;t want to do. Every day. Challenge yourself to be uncomfortable, push past the apathy and laziness and fear. Otherwise, the next day you&#x2019;re going to have two things you don&#x2019;t want to do, then three and four and five, and pretty soon, you can&#x2019;t even get back to the first thing. And then all you can do is beat yourself up for the mess you&#x2019;ve created, and now you&#x2019;ve got a mental barrier to go along with the physical barriers.<br> <br>For my guys, I&#x2019;m the thing they don&#x2019;t want to do. For you, maybe it&#x2019;s something at the office or at home or at the gym. Either way, you have to do those things or you can&#x2019;t improve, you can&#x2019;t be the best, and you sure as hell can&#x2019;t call yourself relentless.<br> <br>Cleaners do the hardest things first, just to show there&#x2019;s no task too big. They might not be happy about it, they don&#x2019;t ever love it, but they&#x2019;re always thinking about the destination, not the bumpy road that takes them there. They do whatever they have to because they know it&#x2019;s necessary, and you usually don&#x2019;t have to tell them twice. More likely, while everyone else is slumped over in complete exhaustion, they&#x2019;ll want to do it all again, and then they&#x2019;ll say the second time was the best.<br> <br>Of course, most highly successful people aren&#x2019;t accustomed to being told what to do. Yes, I know the team staff doesn&#x2019;t make you do this, that&#x2019;s the problem; they can&#x2019;t throw your ass out when you don&#x2019;t show up or you refuse to do the work. I can. The hot tubs, the cold tubs, the therapies, the late nights . . . once we&#x2019;re working together, it&#x2019;s not up to you. Cooperation is mandatory. If you big-time someone on my staff and refuse to get in that cold tub, he&#x2019;ll tell me so I can tell you, &#x201c;Get in the fucking tub.&#x201d; And unless something dramatic has happened to you in the last twenty-four hours that I don&#x2019;t know about and you can change my mind, you&#x2019;re going to get in the tub.<br> <br>Yes, I know it&#x2019;s uncomfortable. I&#x2019;m not telling you to love it. I&#x2019;m telling you to crave the result so intensely that the work is irrelevant. If it makes you feel better, I don&#x2019;t make things comfortable for myself either. I could take these great athletes, maintain their level of fitness, keep them healthy, and everyone would be content. But the challenge for me is taking someone great and making him even better. Michael, Kobe, Dwyane, my Hall of Famers&#x2014;Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen&#x2014;and so many others . . . they come to me because they&#x2019;re not satisfied staying where they are, they&#x2019;re committed to enduring the pain and discomfort of improving on near-perfection, and they know I&#x2019;ll push them until they exceed their goals. If you start with someone average, someone with limited expectations, everything is an improvement. Anyone can do that job. But when you work with someone who&#x2019;s already the best in his field, the opportunity for improvement is a lot less obvious. I&#x2019;m looking for every detail, every slight variable, to see what we can work on, anything to get the slightest edge. In the early days, I trained only Michael; later we added some Bulls teammates. Michael used to say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pay you to train me, I pay you not to train anyone else.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t want anyone else to get that edge.<br> <br>And while that sounds flattering, here&#x2019;s the truth: no trainer or coach or expert can make you good or great or unstoppable if you&#x2019;re not going to do the work, if you&#x2019;re waiting for someone to make it happen for you. It&#x2019;s on you. And that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m telling you all of this, not because I want you to know what I do for my guys, but because I want you to know what you have to do for yourself.<br> <br>Bottom line if you want success of any kind: you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Every time you think you can&#x2019;t, you have to do it anyway. That last mile, the last set, the last five minutes on the clock. You have to play the last game of the season with the same intensity as you played the first. When your body is screaming and depleted and telling you, &#x201c;No way, asshole,&#x201d; you work harder and tell yourself, &#x201c;Do it. Now.&#x201d;<br> <br>You control your body, it does not control you. You shut out the fear and emotion and physical stress and you do the thing you dread. You don&#x2019;t go through the motions and watch the clock until it&#x2019;s over. You invest in what you started, pushing yourself again and again beyond where you&#x2019;ve already been.<br> <br>This is not a Hollywood movie or a shoe commercial with a thumping sound track and special effects. No drama. No fantasy endings. If you want a feel-good story about a trainer bringing a guy from ruin to riches with a warm, fuzzy ending, go watch a Rocky movie. This is real life. If you pass out in the middle of one of my workouts, I&#x2019;m not standing over you to coax you back onto your feet with compassion and support. I&#x2019;m going to make sure you&#x2019;re breathing, and then I&#x2019;m leaving you right there. When you finally come around and you&#x2019;ve cleaned up your puke, come find me and we can get back to work.<br> <br>We always get back to work.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m always thinking up new ways to see how I can push someone, shock the body and rock the mental stamina. If you do what you always do, over and over, you&#x2019;re always going to get the same result. My goal is to make it so challenging in the gym that everything that happens outside the gym seems easy. The work is about testing yourself and preparing all your options, so when you&#x2019;re performing, there&#x2019;s nothing to think about. Do the work before you need it, so you know what you&#x2019;re capable of doing when everyone else hits that panic button and looks at you. Anything you do with me will be so much harder than you&#x2019;ll ever experience in a game situation, you won&#x2019;t have to think about what&#x2019;s happening. You&#x2019;ll just know, and your body will follow.<br> <br>You tell me your limit, and I&#x2019;ll show you how much more you can do. The question is, what is that limit? When Kobe suffered a broken nose and a concussion in the All-Star Game, he was insistent on playing in the Lakers&#x2019; next game. Why? He had to know how his body would respond to the trauma, and what he was capable of doing under those circumstances. Few people know what they&#x2019;re truly able to accomplish, and even fewer want to find out.<br> <br>Can I push you beyond your limit and not break you? How far can you go, and are you willing to go there? You have to be with me 100 percent, not thinking about what you&#x2019;re doing tonight or the bills you have to pay. Complete focus for complete results.<br> <br>When I get focused with a client, I&#x2019;m watching everything: facial expressions, heart rate, how he&#x2019;s sweating, which leg is shaking, everything down to the smallest detail. Then I take all that information, process everything, and decide: Am I willing to push this a little bit further? Because if I do, his progress is going to double in half the time. But he has to be willing to deal with what I&#x2019;m asking of him.<br> <br>A lot of my work has involved bringing athletes back from serious injuries and surgeries, and I always tell a player that when I return him to the game, he won&#x2019;t be the same as he was, he&#x2019;ll be better. He has to be better. Because if he comes back just as he was when he got hurt, he&#x2019;s probably going to get hurt again. So I make him do more than he&#x2019;s ever done and push him harder than he&#x2019;s ever worked, so he can be stronger and more powerful than he was before.<br> <br>But that fear component is a powerful obstacle, and often when we first get started, these guys are just scared to move. For the first time in their lives, they can&#x2019;t rely on their physical abilities or control their own motion, and now they&#x2019;re afraid of their own bodies. It&#x2019;s one of the biggest obstacles to recovery; they no longer want to move. And when you&#x2019;re an athlete who doesn&#x2019;t want to move, you lose your hunger and focus, especially when there&#x2019;s a guaranteed contract with your name on it.

This new title in the Abrams Block Book series features thrilling scenes and fascinating characters from A to Z, perfect for the youngest fan as well as seasoned collectors. As in previous Block Book titles,&nbsp;<i>Marvel Alphablock&nbsp;</i>includes die-cut pages and the stylish art of British design team Peskimo. Each spread highlights important characters every fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe should know&#x2014;from Black Panther to Iron Man to Scarlet Witch.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>PreS-Gr 1-Heroes, unite! Characters from the Marvel Universe populate this hefty board book from the beginning of the alphabet to the end. Each letter has its own dedicated spread and includes characters from Marvel stories whose names represent that letter. Within the spread is the letter itself on a separate, slightly smaller page that serves to divide the letter from its representative subjects. The letter is capitalized and partially cut out, serving at once to encourage the tactile experience of tracing the letter and to make the page easier to turn. Each surface is appealing to the touch, with a matte finish and rounded corners. This, coupled with the weight of the book (not unlike the block for which it is named), make it unique in the world of board books. Excellent illustrations include a significant number of familiar Marvel characters, focusing primarily on those who have been the subjects of major motion pictures in recent years. Fans of Marvel will be spellbound by the craftsmanship of this book: it will provide young readers with one of the most enjoyable alphabet experiences available in print. VERDICT This is the perfect novelty book for young superhero fans to learn the alphabet and immerse themselves in the Marvel universe.

As punishment, the boys have to write a 100-page report on "good citizenship," and they have been specifically ordered NOT to make another comic about Captain Underpants. So what do they do? They create an all-new superhero . . . Super Diaper Baby! Super Diaper Baby's archenemy, Deputy Dangerous, wants to steal his powers and take over the planet. Will the diaper-wearing dynamo defeat the deputy, or is the entire Earth doomed? <br><br>This new paper-over-board edition includes a 16-page behind-the-scenes bonus section!</p><p>Move over, Captain Underpants! There's a tiny new superhero in town. Undaunted by Principal Krupp's insistence that their essay assignment on good citizenship <i>not</i> be another comic book about the briefs-clad warrior, fourth graders George and Harold decide to invent a new superhero. Super Diaper Baby is born! It's up to our fearless infant hero to save the planet from diabolical Deputy Doo-Doo and his reluctantly evil pooch, Danger Dog ("I'm not really evil. I'm just in it for the kibbles."). Several robotic battles, intergalactic digressions, and "flip-o-ramas" later, Super Diaper Baby has done his duty, and George and Harold are in trouble yet again with their principal. Still, it was worth it, as any fan of Dav Pilkey's lowbrow, scatologically inclined "epic novels" (<i>The Adventures of Captain Underpants</i>, <i>Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman</i>, etc.) will attest. George and Harold's spelling is atrocious, their humor is straight off the grade school playground, and kids love every page of it. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i><strong> </strong><b>Notes</b> (from Pilkey.com)<br><br>As everybody already knows, this book was really written by George and Harold's alter ego, Dav Pilkey. <br> <i></i><i>"I know this is going to sound like I'm totally insane, but George and Harold are very real characters to me. I guess it's because I based both of them on myself when I was a kid. So when I started working on this book, I needed to "become" George and Harold. In my imagination, I stopped being me, and sort of let George and Harold take over. I let them create the story they wanted, without worrying about spelling, or grammar, or moralistic plots which would please adults."</i> <b>-- Dav Pilkey</b><br><b> </b><br> Dav was also inspired by the home-made comic books he receives from kids every day. <br> <i></i><i>"The comics that kids send me often have poor grammar and misspelled words, and usually have bad guys who are disgusting in one way or another. But the amazing thing is that these comics are all made voluntarily. Nobody forces these kids to make comic books. They just do it for fun. And there's always something wonderful about that kind of unprompted creativity. I really tried to capture some of that energy in this book" </i><b>-Dav Pilkey</b><br><b> </b><b> <br> </b> <br> <b><br><strong>Fun Facts:</strong><br><strong></strong></b><strong><br><strong> </strong><b>1.

What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems that Backman, in his heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world&#x2019;s most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.<br><br>Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy.

Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive&#x2014;there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, Who will kill him?</p></p><p>Before he was sent to federal prison for treason (among other things), Joel Backman was an extremely powerful man. Known as "the broker," Backman was a high roller--a lawyer making $10 million a year who could "open any door in Washington." That is, until he tried to broker a deal selling access to the world's most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. When caught, Backman accepted prison as the one option that would keep him safe and alive, since the interested parties (the Israelis, the Saudis, the Russians, and the Chinese) were all itching to get their hands on his secrets at any cost. Little does he know that his own government has designs on accessing that information--or at least letting it die with him. Now, six years after his incarceration, the director of the CIA convinces a lame duck president to pardon Backman, and the broker becomes a free man--and an open target.<p> <i>The Broker</i> marries the best of John Grisham's many talents--his ability to immerse himself in the culture of small town life (in this case, Bologna, Italy), and his uncanny mastery of the chase. The first half of the book focuses on Backman's transformation from infamous power broker to helpless victim in his own game. Upon his release from prison, Backman is taken into "protective custody" and whisked off to Italy where he is assigned a new identity, and a tutor to help him blend in. Sure he is on the run, but some readers may feel that Backman's time spent in Bologna is a bit too leisurely--readers join him on an almost cinematic tour through the Italian town, complete with language and history lessons. Impatient readers will be happy to know that the final half of the novel is classic Grisham--a fast-paced, thrilling cat and mouse chase pitting Backman against the numerous agencies that want him dead--as the broker makes a move to take back his life. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Exclusive Video Interview with John Grisham</strong> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td><br><li><i>Watch the interview (high bandwith)</i></li><li><i>Watch the interview (low bandwith)</i></li></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong>Grisham: The Books</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><ul><li><i>A Time to Kill</i>, 1989</li><li><i>The Firm</i>, 1991</li><li><i>The Pelican Brief</i>, 1992</li><li><i>The Client</i>, 1993 </li><li><i>The Chamber</i>, 1994 </li><li><i>The Rainmaker</i>, 1995</li></ul></td><td><ul><li><i>The Runaway Jury</i>, 1996</li><li><i>The Partner</i>, 1997</li><li><i>The Street Lawyer</i>, 1998</li><li><i>The Testament</i>, 1999 </li><li><i>The Brethren</i>, 2000 </li><li><i>A Painted House</i>, 2001</li></ul></td><td><ul><li><i>Skipping Christmas</i>, 2001</li><li><i>The Summons</i>, 2002</li><li><i>The King of Torts</i>, 2003</li><li><i>Bleachers</i>, 2003 </li><li><i>The Last Juror</i>, 2004</li><li><i>The Broker</i>, 2005</li></ul></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p> <strong>Essential Grisham</strong> <br><i>Amazon Editor Favorites</i> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td><br><i>A Time to Kill</i></td><td><br><i>The Firm</i></td><td><br><i>A Painted House</i></td> </tr><tr><td><br><i>The Client</i></td><td><br><i>The Rainmaker</i></td><td><br><i>The Pelican Brief</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Bestselling Grisham</strong> <br><i>Amazon Customer Favorites</i> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td><br><i>The Last Juror</i></td><td><br><i>Skipping Christmas</i></td><td><br><i>Bleachers</i></td> </tr><tr><td><br><i>The Testament</i></td><td><br><i>The Partner</i></td><td><br><i>The King of Torts</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>If You Like Grisham, You'll Love...</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td><ul><li>John Lescroart</li><li>Richard North Patterson</li><li>David Baldacci</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Lisa Scottoline</li><li>Robert Crais</li><li>Michael Crichton</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Harlan Coben</li><li>Dennis Lehane</li><li>Ken Follett</li></ul></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Best Grisham Books on DVD</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td><br><i>A Time to Kill</i></td><td><br><i>The Pelican Brief</i></td><td><br><i>The Client</i></td> </tr><tr><td><br><i>The Firm</i></td><td><br><i>The Rainmaker</i></td><td><br><i>The Chamber</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p>In his final hours in the Oval Office, the outgoing President grants a controversial last-minute pardon to Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison.

Or cry until you laugh. Or maybe you won't cry at all. Either way, you'll definitely laugh.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Funny Girl</i> isn&#x2019;t just an anthology: it&#x2019;s a cause, a mission, a movement. Girls are funny.

A range of well-known authors contribute pieces (Amy Ignatow, Libba Bray, Raina Telgemeier, Ursula Vernon, and Shannon Hale) along with lesser-known writers. The pinkish cover, depicting a girl dangling upside down and reading Funny Girl, is appealing, as are the accessible font styles and comic illustrations throughout. Many of the stories describe bodily functions (farts, poo, pee, and periods all make appearances), proving boys don't have a monopoly on toilet humor. Though the majority of the humor is lighthearted and kid-appropriate, some jokes hit a sour note. In the first story, "How To Tell a Joke" by Delaney Yeager and Mackenzie Yeager, the narrator relates the tale of watching an antidrug assembly featuring a former drug addict with a prosthetic hand. She explains how she later imitated the man by putting her own hand inside her shirt and suggests that this is a good way to get laughs from classmates&#x2014;a gag she comes back to several times in the chapter. Readers whose families have experienced addiction or who have physical disabilities are likely to find these jokes painful rather than chuckle-worthy. Authors and characters come from a range of backgrounds, including Cuban American, Native American, and Indian American. A short biography of each author can be found in the back matter. The stories work especially well when read consecutively, since several jokes recur, but most pieces stand alone. VERDICT With the exception of the first chapter's insensitivity, these stories are bound to engage most readers and tickle ribs.&#x2014;Michelle Anderson, Tauranga City Libraries, New Zealand</p><h2>The Big Black Book of Sex Positions: Take Your Sex Life From Boring To Mind-Blowing in a Few More Than 69 Moves</h2><p>From the writers who brought you <i>The Little Black Book of Sex Positions</i> comes a bigger and better manual than ever before. <i>The Big Black Book of Sex Positions</i> is your go-to guide if you feel like your sex life has gone stale.

This is called a parody. A parody is when you imitate something (usually something famous, like <i>Lord of the Rings or 'Spiderman') and you make your imitation as humorous or as silly as you can. For example, you could make a parody of 'Star Wars' that starred Junie B. Jones as Princess Leia. Parody is a very good example of how you can write about something even if you can't think of an original idea.<br><br>When I wrote 'How The Pee Stoled Potties', I parodied Dr. Seuss's book <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em>. <br><br>I've always been a HUGE fan of Dr. Seuss, and I've read his books so many times that I practically know them by heart. So <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em></i><em> was a perfect story for me to parody.<br><br>I used the same writing style that Dr. Seuss was famous for, but I changed the story to match the rest of the book I was writing. If you compare Dr. Seuss's book with my parody, however, you can find many similarities in the illustration style as well as in the structure and layout. Making a parody of Dr. Seuss's famous book was a great way for me to move my story forward, while mixing things up a bit to make the experience more interesting for my readers. <br><br>So next time you can't think of something to write about, make a PARODY of something you love. <br><br>Not only is it FUN to write parodies, but you'll never get writer's block because the things you're parodying have already been written for you." --Dav Pilkey<br><br><strong>Fun Facts:<br><br>1. Billy's favorite book, Mecha Frog and Robotoad are Enemies is a parody of one of Dav Pilkey's favorite books, Frog and Toad are Friends, by Arnold Lobel.<br> 2. Rip Van Tinkle was originally going to be called "Pee-Pee Longstockings". Dav Pilkey changed his name to Rip Van Tinkle for two reasons: <br> A) he didn't have any stockings, and <br> B) his character awoke to find himself transformed (into a puddle of pee), <br> much like the character, Rip Van Winkle, who awoke to find himself transformed (into an old man).<br> 3. Petey's original name was Ralph. In a very early draft of this story, Ralph was a cat scientist who wore glasses. Dav Pilkey can't remember why he changed him to a regular cat named Petey.<br> 4. Rip Van Tinkle was loosely based on a character that Dav Pilkey created when he was a kid. The character's name was Water Man, and he could do all the same things that Rip Van Tinkle could do. <em><em> </em> </em></strong></em><i><i><i>"Considered one of the most popular contemporary authors for readers in elementary school, (Dav Pilkey) is also regarded as a talented artist and inventive humorist as well as a subtle moralist. ...He underscores his works--even at their most outrageous--with a philosophy that emphasizes friendship, tolerance, and generosity and celebrates the triumph of the good-hearted." </i><b></b><br><b>-The Educational Book &amp; Media Association</b><br><br>Dav Pilkey is the Caldecott Honor Award-winning creator of more than 40 books for children.</i></i></p><h2>Queen Bees and Wannabes, 3rd Edition: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boys, and the New Realities of Girl World</h2><p>&#x201c;My daughter used to be so wonderful.

Ten seconds ago she was a sweet, confident, world-beating little girl who looked up to you. Now she&#x2019;s changing before your very eyes&#x2014;she&#x2019;s confused, insecure, often surly, lashing out. On a good day, she&#x2019;s teary and threatening to run away. On a bad day, you&#x2019;re ready to help her pack her suitcase. She&#x2019;s facing the toughest pressures of adolescent life&#x2014;test-driving her new body, figuring out the social whirl, toughing it out in school&#x2014;and intuitively you know that even though she&#x2019;s sometimes totally obnoxious, she needs you more than ever. Yet it&#x2019;s the very time when she&#x2019;s pulling away from you.<br><br>Why do teenage and preteen girls so often reject their parents and turn to their girlfriends instead&#x2014;even when those friends often treat them so cruelly?<br><br>Every girl I know has been hurt by her girlfriends. One day your daughter comes to school and her friends suddenly decide she no longer belongs. Or she&#x2019;s teased mercilessly for wearing the wrong outfit or having the wrong friend. Maybe she&#x2019;s branded with a reputation she can&#x2019;t shake. Or trapped, feeling she has to conform to what her friends expect from her so she won&#x2019;t be kicked out of the group. No matter what they do to her, she still feels that her friends know her best and want what is best for her. In comparison, she believes that you, previously a reliable source of information, don&#x2019;t have a clue. For parents, being rejected by your daughter is an excruciating experience. Especially when you&#x2019;re immediately replaced by a group of girls with all the tact, sense of fairness, and social graces of a pack of marauding hyenas.<br><br>Whatever you feel as your daughter goes through this process, you can be sure that she&#x2019;ll go through her share of humiliating experiences and constant insecurity&#x2014;that&#x2019;s normal for teens. Most people believe a girl&#x2019;s task is to get through it, grow up, and put those experiences behind her. But your daughter&#x2019;s relationships with other girls have much deeper and farther-reaching implications beyond her turbulent teen years.<br><br>Your daughter&#x2019;s friendships with other girls are a double-edged sword&#x2014;they&#x2019;re key to surviving adolescence, yet they can be the biggest threat to her survival as well. The friendships with the girls in her clique are a template for many relationships she&#x2019;ll have as an adult. Many girls will make it through their teen years precisely because they have the support and care of a few good friends. These are the friendships where a girl truly feels unconditionally accepted and understood&#x2014;and they can last into adulthood and support her search for adult relationships.<br><br>On the other hand, girls can be each other&#x2019;s worst enemies. Girls&#x2019; friendships in adolescence are often intense, confusing, frustrating, and humiliating, the joy and security of &#x201c;best friends&#x201d; shattered by devastating breakups and betrayals. Girls&#x2019; reactions to the ups and downs of these friendships are as intense as they&#x2019;ll later feel in intimate relationships.<br><br>These early relationships can propel girls into making dangerous decisions and shape how they mature into young women. But your daughter is too close to it all to realize the good and bad influence of her friends. She needs guidance from you.<br><br>This book will examine cliques, reputations, gossiping, rebellion, bullying, crushes, and boyfriends. It will show you how your daughter is conditioned to remain silent when intimidated by more powerful girls&#x2014;and the lessons she learns from this experience. It will teach you how to recognize which friends will support her and which could lead her toward situations that threaten her emotional health and sometimes even her physical safety. It&#x2019;ll show you how your daughter&#x2019;s place in her social pecking order can affect whether she&#x2019;ll be a perpetrator, bystander, or victim of violence when she&#x2019;s older. This book will also reveal how these dynamics contribute to the disconnection and struggle between the two of you.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll also describe and explain the key rites of passage your daughter is likely to experience: getting an invitation to an exclusive party in sixth grade . . . or getting left off the guest list; her first breakup with a friend; the first time she dresses up for a party in the latest style; and so on. These are all critical milestones for her, but they&#x2019;re rites of passage for you, too. Just as they can be exhilarating or traumatizing for her, they can be equally challenging for you as her parent, and not just in terms of the extent to which they try your patience; mishandling them can threaten your relationship with her. I&#x2019;ll help you navigate them together.<br><br>Moreover, this book will show you how constantly changing cultural ideals of femininity impact your daughter&#x2019;s self-esteem, friendships, and social status and can combine to make her more likely to have sex at an early age and be vulnerable to violence at the hands of some men and boys. It will also explain what you can do to help your daughter avoid these pitfalls.<br><br>Understanding your teen or preteen daughter&#x2019;s friendships and social life can be difficult and frustrating. Parents often tell me they feel totally shut out from this part of their daughter&#x2019;s life, incapable of exerting any influence.<br><br>This book will let you in. It&#x2019;ll show how to help your daughter deal with the nasty things girls do to one another and minimize the negative effects of what&#x2019;s often an invisible war behind girls&#x2019; friendships.<br><br>Before I go any further, let me reassure you that I can help you even if you often feel that you&#x2019;re at war with your daughter.<br><br>It&#x2019;s perfectly natural at this stage that she:<br><br>* Stops looking to you for answers.<br><br>* Doesn&#x2019;t respect your opinion as much as she did before.<br><br>* Believes that there&#x2019;s no possible way that you could understand what she&#x2019;s going through.<br><br>* Lies and sneaks behind your back.<br><br>* Denies she lied and went behind your back&#x2014;even in the face of undeniable evidence.<br><br><b>On the other hand, it&#x2019;s natural that you:</b><br><br>* Feel rejected when she rolls her eyes at everything you say.<br><br>* Have moments when you really don&#x2019;t like her.<br><br>* Wonder whose child this is anyway because this person in front of you can&#x2019;t possibly be your sweet wonderful daughter.<br><br>* Feel confused when conversations end in fights.<br><br>* Feel misunderstood when she feels you&#x2019;re intruding and prying when you ask what&#x2019;s going on in her life.<br><br>* Are really worried about the influence of her friends and feel powerless to stop her hanging out with them. (Because, of course, she&#x2019;ll keep the friends you don&#x2019;t like if you expressly forbid her from seeing them.)<br><br><b>The Mother/Daughter Maelstrom</b><br><br>Moms and daughters seem to have the hardest time with each other during girls&#x2019; adolescence. Your daughter craves privacy, and you directly threaten her sense of privacy. You feel you have so much to offer her&#x2014;after all, you&#x2019;ve been through the changes she&#x2019;s experiencing&#x2014;and you think your advice will help. Think of your daughter as a beaver; she&#x2019;s constantly cutting down logs, branches, twigs, anything she can find, dragging them to her den, trying to create a safe haven from the outside world. In her eyes, you&#x2019;re always stomping on it: asking why the logs are there in the first place when you have this nice one that would look so pretty; rearranging the branches; hovering around the entranceway yelling your suggestions and saying that it would look much better if it was just a little more organized. You&#x2019;re not just totally disturbing her peace, you&#x2019;re storming her sacred retreat.<br><br>While this privacy war is natural, it creates a big problem. Girls are often so focused on resisting the influence of their parents that they rarely see when their peers are influencing them in the wrong way. Teens often see things in very concrete, either/or ways. You, as the parent, are intrusive and prying, which equals bad; her peers are involved and understanding, which equals good. She pushes you away, making even more space for the bad influences.<br><br><b>Fathers Feel It, Too</b><br><br>This book isn&#x2019;t only for mothers. Fathers also have struggles with the child who just moments ago was &#x201c;Daddy&#x2019;s little girl.&#x201d; Still, there are many ways your unique perspective can help your daughter. Just because you were never a girl doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t help your daughter get through all this mess. In fact, it could be a lot worse. You could be the mother. Even if you&#x2019;re raising your daughter on your own, you still probably won&#x2019;t get into the teeth-baring, no-holds-barred battles that mothers and daughters do. I know lots of dads feel rejected and pushed aside when their little girl suddenly turns into a moody teenager. But in reality, this is an opportunity for you to become a genuinely cool dad. I don&#x2019;t mean you let her get away with stuff, side with her against the mom, or drive her wherever she wants. I&#x2019;m talking about the dad who patiently waits around until she wants to talk, then listens without being judgmental, isn&#x2019;t afraid to look foolish or show his emotions, shares the &#x201c;boy perspective,&#x201d; and is able to communicate his concerns without coming across as controlling and dogmatic. You&#x2019;re probably dying to warn your daughter off those hormonally crazed ruffians panting at the door; you were one once and you still remember what it felt like. But if you launch in with &#x201c;what boys really want&#x201d; and come across as the crazy-control-freak-doesn&#x2019;t-have-a-clue father, you&#x2019;ve lost a golden opportunity. Your job is to present your wisdom in a credible manner so she won&#x2019;t blow you off and think your opinions are outdated and irrelevant. Through your relationship with her, you can teach her that her relationships with men must be mutually respectful and caring. This book will help you.<br><br><b>Believe It or Not, Your Daughter Still Wants You in Her Life</b><br><br>When I ask girls privately, even those who struggle the most with their parents, they tell me they want their parents to be proud of them. You may look at her in the middle of an argument when she&#x2019;s screaming that she hates you and think there&#x2019;s no way you can get through to her, but you can and will if you learn to see the world through her eyes.<br><i><br>You always want attention from your parents. Especially if you&#x2019;re doing something you aren&#x2019;t sure about.</i><br>Sam, 15<br><br><i>Parents don&#x2019;t realize that their children look up to them.

But they accept me for who I am and my parents don&#x2019;t.</i><br>Jill, 14<br><br><b>Developing Your Girl Brain<br></b><br>Parents tell me that one of the hardest things they have to accept is that as their daughters get older, they have less control over which people they hang out with. They hate admitting that they won&#x2019;t be there when their daughters face the difficult decisions that could impact their health and safety. When your daughter was little, she came crying to you when there was a problem and you swept in like a white knight to solve it. Now, you&#x2019;re lucky if you even have a clue what the problem is, and if you sweep in to save the day instead of teaching your daughter how to handle it, she&#x2019;ll either be angry with you for intruding or believe she can&#x2019;t learn to take care of herself. How can you help her? Start by thinking the way she does.<br><br>In this book I will teach you to develop a girl brain. It&#x2019;s like looking at the world through a new pair of glasses. Developing this ability isn&#x2019;t dependent on using the latest slang (and it&#x2019;s impossible to keep up anyway). The key to building your relationship with your daughter is understanding why she&#x2019;s turning away from you and toward her friends, and maintaining a relationship with her anyway. And even though she may be acting as if you aren&#x2019;t an important influence in her life, you are&#x2014;she just may not want to admit it. If you can learn how to be her safe harbor when she&#x2019;s in trouble, your voice will be in her head along with your values and ethics.<br><br>The first step is to understand what your daughter&#x2019;s world&#x2014;the Girl World&#x2014;looks like, who has power, who intimidates her, whom she intimidates, where she feels safe, and where she doesn&#x2019;t. Where and when does she feel comfortable and with whom? Who does she go to for advice? What common things can ruin her day or make her feel on top of the world? An even harder task is to assess her. What is she being teased about? Why are other children mean to her? Or even harder to admit, why would she be cruel to others? What would make her lie or sneak behind your back? Get inside her head, and you&#x2019;ll understand where she&#x2019;s coming from.<br><br>It helps to remember what it was like to be your daughter&#x2019;s age. Remember your experiences, the role models (both good and bad), and the lessons learned from your family, your school, and your culture. Suspend the worry, the common sense, and the wisdom you have accumulated over the last years. Think back to what you were like and what was important to you back then.<br><br><b>Remembering the Lunch Tray Moments</b><br><br>Let&#x2019;s go back to middle school (are you suppressing an involuntary shudder?). Parents, teachers, and other adults are telling you what to do. They&#x2019;re especially telling you what you can&#x2019;t do. You have a close group of friends, but for some reason one of your best friends comes up to you between classes and tells you that one of your other friends is spreading rumors about you. Your face feels hot; you can feel everyone looking at you. Thoughts race through your head. What did you do? Why is she mad at you? Are your friends going to back you or side with her? All of a sudden, a question drives an icy stake of fear through your heart as you stand there clutching your orange plastic lunch tray in the cafeteria line: Where are you going to sit at lunch?<br><br>Can you remember what it was like? Not too pleasant. As adults, we can laugh at how immense and insurmountable problems like those &#x201c;Lunch Tray Moments&#x201d; can feel when you&#x2019;re young.

From the &#x201c;jaws&#x201d; of the Venus flytrap to the pretty sundew plant whose delicate tentacles entrap its prey, the unique anatomy and behaviors of meat-eating plants are detailed with clear, engaging text and art.</p><p><b>Mary Batten</b> is an award-winning science writer whose previous books&#x2014;<i>Discovery by Chance</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Tropical Forest</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Nature&#x2019;s Tricksters</i>&#x2014;were written for the juvenile market.

She has written scripts for fifty television films, the producers of which include Time-Life Films, Children's Television Workshop, National Geographic, and Disney Educational Productions. She lives in Virginia.This intriguing book in the Road to Reading series provides a sound introduction to one of children's favorite plants, the Venus flytrap, along with the sundew, pitcher plant, and the bladderwort--just a few of the 600 kinds of carnivorous plants that exist. The basic facts about the structure and behavior of these plants are presented, including the way they're designed and whether they're active or passive traps. The sundew, for example, has tentacles containing thousands of tiny sticky balls that glisten like dewdrops. An insect looking for a sip of nectar will get stuck and not be able to pull free. The harder it pulls the more glue the sundew makes. Then this passive trap becomes very active. The sticky tentacles slowly curl around the insect, squeezing it to death and digesting it with acids. In clear, concise language supported by detailed color illustrations, Batten and Mirocha have created an informative and fascinating first chapter book. <i>Shelley Townsend-Hudson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The clinically proven answer is yes, and&nbsp;<i>The Longevity Diet</i>&nbsp;is easier to follow than you'd think. The culmination of 25 years of research on aging, nutrition, and disease across the globe, this unique program lays out a simple solution to living&nbsp;to a healthy old age through nutrition. The key is combining the healthy everyday eating plan the book outlines, with the scientifically engineered fasting-mimicking diet, or FMD; the FMD, done just 3-4 times a year, does away with the misery and starvation most of us experience while fasting, allowing you to reap all the beneficial health effects of a restrictive diet, while avoiding negative stressors, like low energy and sleeplessness. Valter Longo, director of the Longevity Institute at USC and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM in Milan, designed the FMD after making a series of remarkable discoveries in mice, then in humans, indicating that specific diets can activate stem cells and promote regeneration and rejuvenation in multiple organs to significantly reduce risk for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and heart disease. Longo&#x2019;s simple pescatarian daily eating plan and the periodic fasting-mimicking techniques can both yield impressive results. Low in proteins and sugars and rich in healthy fats and plant-based foods, The Longevity Diet is proven to help you:&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Lose weight and reduce abdominal fat<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Extend your&nbsp;healthy&nbsp;lifespan with simple everyday changes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Prevent age-related muscle and bone loss<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Build your resistance to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and cancer<br> &nbsp;<br> Longo&#x2019;s healthy, life span-extending program is based on an easy-to-adopt pescatarian plan along with the fasting-mimicking diet no more than 4 times a year, just 5 days at a time. Including 30 easy recipes for an everyday diet based on Longo's five pillars of longevity,&nbsp;<i>The Longevity Diet</i>&nbsp;is the key to living a longer, healthier, more fulfilled life.</p><p><b>Valter Longo</b> is the director of the Longevity Institute at USC in Los Angeles, and of the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM (Molecular Oncology FIRC Institute) in Milan. His studies focus on the fundamental mechanisms of aging in simple organisms and mice and on how they can be translated to humans. Dr. Longo received the 2010 Nathan Shock Lecture Award from the National Institute on Aging (NIA/NIH) and the 2013 Vincent Cristofalo "Rising Star" Award in Aging Research from the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR).<p><i>Chapter 1</i></p><p>Caruso&#x2019;s Fountain</p><p>Back to Molochio</p><p>Drive an hour and a half north from the southernmost tip of Italy and you&#x2019;ll reach a little town called Molochio in the region of -Calabria. Its name is probably derived from the Greek word molokh&#x113;, meaning &#x201c;mallow,&#x201d; which is a medicinal plant with a bright purple flower. In the central piazza, there&#x2019;s a fountain you can safely drink from, its cold water flowing via underground springs directly from the Aspromonte mountains.</p><p>In 1972, when I was five years old, I spent six months in Molochio with my mother, who had gone there to stay with my ailing grandfather. For many years, my nonno Alfonso had neglected a hernia, a simple condition that could have been treated with the right care. The day he died, everyone was calling his name to wake him. I walked in the room and said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see that he has died already?&#x201d; I was very close to my grandfather, and his death caused me great sadness; but even as a child, I felt that dealing with aging and death was something that I was supposed to do, that I had to take charge of the situation somehow.</p><p>Our neighbor in Molochio, Salvatore Caruso, was about the same age as my grandfather. In 2012, forty years after my grandfather&#x2019;s death, Salvatore and I would appear in the same issue of the scientific journal Cell Metabolism for my group&#x2019;s discovery that a low-protein diet, based on the eating habits of Molochio&#x2019;s elders, is associated with low cancer and overall mortality rates in the US population. The cover image of 108-year-old Salvatore standing among the Calabrian olive trees made the pages of The Washington Post and media around the globe. Two years after that, Salvatore was the oldest man in Italy, and one of four centenarians living in Molochio. Since there were only around two thousand people living there at the time, this meant Molochio had one of the highest proportions of centenarians in the world (four times that of Okinawa, Japan, which is believed to have the highest rate of centenarians for a large region).</p><p>Salvatore, who died in 2015 at the age of 110, started drinking from Molochio&#x2019;s fountain soon after he was born in 1905; given the exceptional longevity of so many of the town elders, it&#x2019;s tempting to think it might be the closest thing we have to a real fountain of youth. But while that&#x2019;s an interesting thought, I&#x2019;ve spent most of my life studying the science of living long, and the truth is nothing so enchanted. You don&#x2019;t need to travel to Molochio to drink from its fountain of youth&#x2014;but if you did, you would learn many of the secrets of longevity from its centenarians.</p><p>From Tradition to Science</p><p>Whether by luck or destiny, my life took a path that has given me a unique and invaluable perspective on different diets and cultures. From the Calabrian diet of Molochio, where I spent childhood summers, to the pescetarian Ligurian diet of Genoa, where I was raised, to the heavy American diets of Chicago and Texas, to the health-obsessed diet of that mecca of youthfulness, Los Angeles&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve lived the full range of good, bad, and excellent nutrition, which has helped me formulate hypotheses about the -connection between food, disease, and longevity. It also helped me realize that in order to understand how people can live long, healthy lives, we need to go beyond scientific, epidemiological, and clinical studies and investigate actual populations that age successfully.</p><p>Although I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, I grew up between two places that boast among the healthiest traditional diets in the world. Unlike other regions of Italy famous for their meats (Tuscany) or their heavy cream-based sauces (Lazio, Emilia--Romagna), Liguria and Calabria maintained a cuisine based on complex -carbohydrates and vegetables, with dishes like minestrone, pansotti al sugo di noce (a ravioli-like pasta with vegetable filling served in a walnut sauce), and farinata (garbanzo beans and olive oil). During the summers of my childhood in Calabria, we lived simply; almost every morning my brother or sister or I walked up the hill to the bakery to buy fresh bread, hot from the oven, dark from the whole wheat from which it was made. About once every other day, for either lunch or dinner, we ate pasta e vaianeia, which consisted of a small amount of pasta tossed together with large amounts of vegetables, particularly green beans cooked in the pod. Another common dish was stoccafisso, or stockfish&#x2014;a dried cod similar to baccala but without the salt&#x2014;served with a vegetable side dish. Other common ingredients of our diet growing up were black olives, olive oil, and lots of tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers. Meat was a once-a-week treat; only on Sundays would we have homemade maccheroni pasta with polpette (meatballs)&#x2014;two each&#x2014;or sometimes a small steak. The most common drinks were water (from the mountain spring), local wine, tea, coffee, and almond milk. We often drank goat&#x2019;s milk instead of cow&#x2019;s milk in the morning. Between meals we were allowed to snack only on peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, raisins, grapes, or corn on the cob. Once we finished dinner around 8 p.m., we usually wouldn&#x2019;t eat anything until the next morning. Even at our celebratory village fairs, the sweets were made with nuts and dried fruit. And instead of ice cream, we would often have granita, the frozen dessert somewhere between a smoothie and a sorbet. Made with lots of fruit, it is, in my -opinion, the best dessert in the world, but it does contain a lot of&nbsp;sugar. We had to go six miles down the road, to the town of Taurianova, to find the good one.</p><p>The traditional diet of Genoa and its region Liguria is arguably as healthy as that of Calabria&#x2019;s; low in sugar, it consists of a lot&nbsp;of vegetables, garbanzo beans, olive oil, anchovies, codfish, and mussels, all of which represent important components of the Longevity Diet I present in this book.</p><p>From Ligurian to Chicagoan</p><p>When I was twelve years old, I would lock myself in my room with my electric guitar, turn the amplifier up to ten, and play along to the albums of Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd. I dreamed of going to America to become a rock star. That opportunity came in 1984 when, at age sixteen, I left Genoa to live with my aunt in Chicago. A music-crazed teenager, I arrived in the Little Italy district of Melrose Park, in the Chicago suburbs, with my guitar sticking out of my backpack, lugging a portable amp. My spoken-language skills were so bad that the immigration -official stamped &#x201c;no English&#x201d; on my passport. Chicago had an incredible music scene. I took guitar lessons with Stewart Pearce, an iconic local bebop player. I was mostly interested in rock, but I knew that learning to play jazz and bebop would make me a much better rock guitar player. On weekends, I would sneak out of my aunt&#x2019;s house and take the L train downtown, where I would plug in and jam with musicians in blues clubs all night long.</p><p>My exposure to some of the best blues in the world coincided with my exposure to some of the unhealthiest food in the world&#x2014;what I consider &#x201c;the heart attack diet.&#x201d; At the time, I knew nothing about nutrition and aging, but I remember thinking something must be wrong with the Windy City diet because so many of my&nbsp;relatives there&#x2014;mostly ethnic Calabrians&#x2014;were dying of cardiovascular diseases, which were relatively uncommon in southern Italy in general, and were particularly rare in my extended family.</p><p>These southern Italians in America were eating bacon and sausage with, eggs for breakfast, then lots of pasta, bread and meat for lunch, often having meat again for dinner. They also consumed high quantities of cheese, milk, and high-fat, high-sugar desserts. The famous Chicago pizza had more calories from cheese than from the dough. Drinks were usually sodas or equally high-fructose fruit juices. To make matters worse, much of the food we Chicagoans ate was fried. Not surprisingly, many people I knew were overweight or obese by age thirty. Although I never became obese, I ate like everyone else and grew a lot during my three years in Chicago. My height shot up to six feet two, almost eight inches taller than my father and four inches taller than my brother. A possible explanation for this was all the meat suddenly in my diet, which, along with protein, probably contained steroid hormones.</p><p>I graduated high school in Chicago and headed south to study jazz performance at the famous University of North Texas College of Music. I could never have imagined eating more or becoming bigger than I was in Chicago&#x2014;until I joined the Army Reserve as a way to pay for my education in Texas. Arriving for boot camp in Fort Knox, Kentucky, I joined a battalion of Army tankers who trained with the Marines and took pride in pushing themselves to the limit. We slept only three or four hours a night, did push-ups and other vigorous exercises all day long, and we ate&#x2014;a lot.</p><p>I spent two summers at Fort Knox doing things I never would have believed myself capable of. It was the toughest and probably the best training of my life. The Army taught me how to get things done quickly, meeting the highest standards while minimizing or eliminating mistakes. Our trainers expected the impossible all the time. If you could do fifty push-ups, they told us, you should be going for a hundred. If you could run two miles in twelve -minutes, they&#x2019;d scream, you should finish in ten. I found out that sometimes when the impossible is expected, it can be achieved&#x2014;eventually I was able to run two miles in ten minutes.</p><p>The Army diet was based on meat and carbohydrates, with sugary sodas allowed as a reward only if we had a combined run, push-up, and sit-up score of 200&#x2014;which meant about seventy push-ups and sixty sit-ups in under two minutes each, plus running two miles in under ten and a half minutes. In retrospect, I&nbsp;can see how addicted we all were to sugary drinks; we craved that mix of phosphoric acid, caramel coloring, and sugar, and -everyone envied the very few who could reach that 200-point mark.</p><p>This diet, along with the grueling exercise regimen, made me a lot bigger, increasing the size of my muscles and making me stronger&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s what I assumed at the time. As I will explain in more detail in a later chapter, our recent studies indicate that a protein-rich diet, which can increase muscle size, may not necessarily translate into increased muscle strength and that a -periodic low-protein, low-sugar diet, alternating with periods of normal protein intake, may do more to generate new muscle cells (which we currently think has more to do with strength than size does) while promoting health. In the ten years after basic training, during which my diet consisted of a lot of meat, fats, and proteins, my strength and stamina were dramatically reduced. But then I slowly switched to the Longevity Diet, and more than twenty-five years later I can do about the same number of push-ups and sit-ups as I did at boot camp when I was nineteen and supposedly in peak shape.</p><p>My stint in the Army eventually got me interested in how and why different types of diets can improve health without negatively affecting muscle mass and strength. The answer lies in nutritechnology, a new field I have helped create, in which we treat ingredients found in normal food as a complex set of molecules that, in specific doses and combinations, can have drug-like beneficial properties that we can harness to delay aging and prevent disease.</p></p><h2>The 50th Law (The Robert Greene Collection)</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p>A hip hop icon joins forces with the best-selling author of <em>The 48 Laws of Power</em> to write a bible for success in life and work living by one simple principle: fear nothing.</p><p>Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is an American rapper.

P. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in the US in 1890. Influenced by various literary interests, from the Tales of Arabian Nights, to Greek mythology and to 19th century Gothic tales told to him by his grandfather, Lovecraft mixed these together with an interest in science. From this background, he gave voice to his ideas in a series of dark tales of fantasy and horror. He suffered from ill health, at one point having a nervous breakdown, and he was unable to attend university, which was a huge disappointment to him. He died in 1937, but his legacy lives on in a body of work that has inspired countless films, TV series, board games and toys, as well as the work of many other writers.</p><h2>Spectrum Spelling Workbook Grade 2, Phonics and Handwriting Practice With Sight Words, Vowels, and Compound Words, 2nd Grade Workbook With English ... or Homeschool Curriculum (Volume 72)</h2><p>Help children spell their way to success!

Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

We also trace the paths with our fingers. She mostly likes scribbling at this point but she will get it since this book will last a long time. --School Zone Website<br><br>My daughter has been working on tracing more at daycare in the preschool room, and she was getting really good at it, but I wanted her to keep practicing. I bought this book hoping she'd use it a few times, and she uses it several times a week! She absolutely loves tracing in it. I think it's having special markers for it, and the different activities. One thing to note: be sure to wipe it off right away when you're done with it, as it gets really hard to remove once it's been sitting for a day or so. Still comes off by using cleaner, but just takes more effort. Also, it doesn't come with markers, so make sure to pick some of those up too! --Amazon<br><br>I got this book last week, and already my 3 year old daughter has improved greatly! She draws straight lines and beautiful circles now, all because of the dry erase, trace-the-dashed-lines features in the book. She absolutely loves using her book. She will color, trace, draw, erase, and repeat for hours...which is saying a lot because her attention span is not usually that great! The pictures are cute and engaging as well.

Follow @jonathanwstokes.<b>Chapter One:&nbsp;Fear of Heights<br></b><br> Addison Cooke sat cross-legged in the school library, engrossed in an Incan history book. Under the spell of a decent read, Addison could forget meals, forget sleep, and even forget to go to class. He could forget to go to school or, once at school, forget to go home. This was, in fact, the current situation.<br><br>The school bell had rung ages ago, and Addison had missed it entirely.<br><br>Addison&#x2019;s little sister, Molly, sprinted into the library. She was still wearing soccer cleats and shin guards from intramural practice.<br><br>&#x201c;Addison!&#x201d; she hissed.<br><br>Addison perked up, looked around for the source of the whisper, and spotted his sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Molly, what are you doing down there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me? What are you doing on top of the bookshelf?&#x201d;<br><br>Addison was, at present, perched on top of a six-foot bookshelf.<br><br>&#x201c;Overcoming my fear of heights. And reading up on Incan history. It&#x2019;s called multitasking.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison, like any seventh grader at Public School 141, sported a tidy uniform: a sharp blazer, power tie, and khaki pants. Never wanting to blend in, he topped off his uniform with a smart ivy cap perched on his head at a rakish angle.<br><br>Molly, a sixth grader, had more than a decade of solid experience with Addison&#x2019;s odd behavior. She was more or less used to it. &#x201c;I ran to your classroom to find you, but Ms. Johnson said you weren&#x2019;t in class all afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got a nurse&#x2019;s pass.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re not sick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Naturally. I got the nurse&#x2019;s pass from Eddie Chang,&#x201d; Addison explained. &#x201c;He was sick last week. I traded him his nurse&#x2019;s pass for an owl pellet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s an owl pellet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You ask too many questions. You should consider a career in tabloid reporting, or police interrogation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Addison, skipping all these classes could catch up to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gotten by so far. Besides, I&#x2019;m only skipping class to further my education.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison Cooke possessed infinite confidence in all things Addison Cooke.<br><br>Molly Cooke, however, did not share this same feeling. &#x201c;Well, hurry up,&#x201d; she said, whispering as loudly as the library allowed. &#x201c;We have two strikes with Aunt Delia already. If we miss the bus again, she&#x2019;ll kill us!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somehow, I doubt that. She is our flesh and blood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll at least ground us,&#x201d; Molly growled.<br><br>Even Addison saw the truth in this. He sighed, gathered his library books into his messenger bag, and began climbing down the tall bookshelf.<br><br>&#x201c;No need to panic, Molly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not panicking!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sooner or later, you are going to learn that I have everything under control.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison stepped on a loose shelf. It overturned, flipping all the books&#x2014;and Addison&#x2014;onto the ground.<br><br>He landed hard on his back.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right.&#x201d;<br><br>Molly looked down at him, knuckles on her hips. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re supposed to be a good influence on me.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison hurriedly reshelved the books before sprinting after Molly.<br><br>***<br><br>Addison and Molly burst out of the front doors of PS 141, Theodore Roosevelt Middle School, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. They watched the last school bus disappear, turning right on 72nd Street toward Central Park.<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Molly. We&#x2019;ll catch them at Columbus Avenue!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to outrun a school bus?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could use the exercise&#x2014;I skipped PE today. Besides, you already have your running shoes on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;These are soccer cleats!&#x201d;<br><br>But Addison had already taken off running. Molly chased after him, her cleats clacking like maracas on the pavement.<br><br>They dashed past the hot-dog vendor with his rolling cart. Past the cook fire smells of the pretzel vendor. They sprinted past Mr. Karabidian&#x2019;s ice cream cart.<br><br>&#x201c;Missed the bus again, Addison?&#x201d; called Mr. Karabidian.<br><br>&#x201c;Time waits for no man,&#x201d; replied Addison as he flew by, &#x201c;and neither does the bus.&#x201d; Addison put on a fresh burst of speed, now struggling to keep pace with Molly.<br><br>&#x201c;The shortcut!&#x201d; she called, ducking down a service alley. They bolted along loading docks and leapt over shipping flats, Addison desperate not to lose any of his Incan library books.<br><br>Turbaned men reclining on blankets played chess in the shade of the alleyway. Women with machetes shaved ice behind the Thai restaurant. Addison and Molly swept past them with the speed of two scalded squirrels.<br><br>They emerged from the alley at full tilt, upsetting a flock of warbling pigeons on Central Park West. &#x201c;There it is!&#x201d; Addison called, pointing.<br><br>Molly watched in dismay as their school bus chugged uptown, passing the 79th Street Transverse. It trundled into the distance, disappearing in the afternoon traffic.<br><br>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d; Molly squatted down to retie her cleats.<br><br>&#x201c;Never fear, young relative. We will catch a taxi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not allowed to take taxis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you mentioned that. Because I cannot afford a taxi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to hurry. Aunt Delia will be home any minute!&#x201d;<br><br>Addison surveyed the bustling Manhattan street traffic. &#x201c;The important thing is to remain levelheaded and to make use of one&#x2019;s environment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s two things. And you sound just like Uncle Nigel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Addison beamed. &#x201c;You know, the taxi is not the fastest animal in the concrete jungle. That honor belongs to the Bike Messenger.&#x201d; Addison knew there were few creatures in any jungle more quick, daring, and potentially lethal than a New York City Bike Messenger. &#x201c;I will just flag one down.&#x201d;<br><br>For Addison, having an idea was the same thing as acting on it. He jumped in front of the speeding path of a passing bike messenger. The cyclist spotted Addison flapping his arms and swerved hard at the last moment, brakes squealing.<br><br>&#x201c;Watch it, kid!&#x201d; shouted the bike messenger, skidding to a stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, I apologize, but I require your services.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You could have gotten me killed!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A small price to pay for what is at stake,&#x201d; Addison calmly replied.<br><br>&#x201c;You need a delivery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a word, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Got any money?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening,&#x201d; said the bike messenger.<br><br>&#x201c;I need you to take me and my sister home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I deliver packages, not kids.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference?&#x201d;<br><br>The bike messenger considered this question, probably for the first time in his life. &#x201c;Size, mostly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you take us home, I can pay you when we get there,&#x201d; suggested Addison.<br><br>&#x201c;If you grow wings, I won&#x2019;t need to take you,&#x201d; the bike messenger replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d; Addison slipped off his school dress shoe and peeled five crumpled one-dollar bills from under his insole. &#x201c;I keep emergency funds for just such scenarios. How far uptown will five dollars get me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;73rd Street,&#x201d; said the bike messenger.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re on 73rd Street,&#x201d; Addison observed.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, 76th.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make it 86th Street, and you&#x2019;ve got yourself a deal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;79th and not one inch farther.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison climbed on the bicycle seat, which was pretty high off the ground for him. Molly balanced her cleats on the rear wheel axle, her hands on Addison&#x2019;s shoulders. The bike messenger rode seatless, huffing and puffing to get the cycle moving.<br><br>Soon they careened through the Manhattan streets at breakneck speed. Pedestrians yelped and leapt out of their speeding path. Molly clung to Addison, who clung to the bike messenger. Addison&#x2019;s tie flapped behind him; Molly squinted her eyes in the headwind. They wove through traffic, slicing within inches of passing cars.<br><br>&#x201c;I could get used to this,&#x201d; said Addison.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re there,&#x201d; said the bike messenger, squeaking to a stop.<br><br>Molly dismounted, looking grateful to be alive. Addison straightened his windblown hair and thanked the bike messenger.<br><br>&#x201c;Truth is, I was going this direction anyway,&#x201d; said the messenger. &#x201c;But I figured I might as well get paid for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I respect your entrepreneurial spirit,&#x201d; said Addison.<br><br>&#x201c;Kid, here&#x2019;s my card if you ever need anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison gratefully accepted the bike messenger&#x2019;s business card and offered his own in exchange. In impeccable felt-tipped penmanship, Addison&#x2019;s card read:<br><br>Addison Cooke<br> ARCHAEOLOGIST<br> Rates negotiable<br><br>The bike messenger cocked his knuckles to his cap, saluting Addison. He set foot to pedal, ready to cycle north. &#x201c;Got a tip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Addison replied. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t let kids ride without helmets.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Addison and Molly raced the final seven blocks to their apartment building on West 86th Street. Addison skidded to a halt, his jaw dropped in horror. Aunt Delia was already climbing the front steps of their brownstone apartment building.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re so busted!&#x201d; Molly exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t afford another grounding. Let&#x2019;s try the back door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Addison&#x2014;we live on the fifth floor&#x2014;there is no back door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True. But there is a fire escape.&#x201d;<br><br>Molly and Addison dashed into the back alley, frightening a skulking cat. The siblings clambered on top of the alley Dumpster to reach the wrought-iron rungs of the fire-escape ladder. Addison began climbing.<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, hurry up,&#x201d; urged Molly.<br><br>Halfway up the ladder, Addison froze. He stared down at the pavement far below, entranced.<br><br>&#x201c;Could you go any slower?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just give me a sec,&#x201d; said Addison.<br><br>Molly sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your fear of heights, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s call for Raj or Eddie. If their windows are open, they&#x2019;ll come out and help you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you shout for them, Aunt Delia will hear you.&#x201d;<br><br>Molly caught up to Addison on the ladder. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t look down. Take deep breaths. You&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need help. I&#x2019;m fine!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison&#x2019;s legs shook. His heart beat against his ribs like a gorilla rattling the bars of its cage.<br><br>&#x201c;Addison?&#x201d;<br><br>He sighed and shut his eyes, realizing he couldn&#x2019;t possibly climb to the fifth floor. Slowly, Addison climbed back down to the Dumpster, defeated. He carefully lowered himself to the pavement. Feet on solid earth again, Addison took a moment to collect his breath.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it,&#x201d; said Molly. &#x201c;When are you going to get over this phobia?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forget it. Let&#x2019;s just go in the front door before Aunt Delia calls in the National Guard. We&#x2019;re in deep enough already.&#x201d;<br><br>Furious with himself, Addison quietly led Molly out of the alleyway.<br><br>***<br><br>Aunt Delia shook her head back and forth so that her ponytail wagged. She had the frazzled look of a person with three days&#x2019; worth of work to do and only three hours to do it. She folded her tortoiseshell glasses and set them loudly on the counter.<br><br>Addison and Molly stared meekly at the black and white tiles of the kitchen floor.<br><br>&#x201c;Addison, it&#x2019;s like you never listen,&#x201d; said Aunt Delia, wringing her hands.<br><br>&#x201c;I do listen. I just never follow instructions,&#x201d; Addison corrected.<br><br>Aunt Delia held up one palm, silencing Addison. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hear it.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison pursed his lips and did his best to hold his peace.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re grounded,&#x201d; said Aunt Delia. &#x201c;Again,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;No television, no sleepovers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Aunt Delia wound up for her knockout punch. &#x201c;And, Addison&#x2014;no visits to Bruno&#x2019;s Fossil Emporium for a month.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, c&#x2019;mon!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No lip, Addison. This is about more than following instructions. When you give me your word, I need to know I can trust you. You need to start accepting some responsibility. Traveling the city by yourself&#x2014;what if something had happened to you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wish something would happen to me,&#x201d; Addison blurted out. &#x201c;School is unimaginably, inconceivably, impossibly boring. You and Uncle Nigel are always leaving the country. Flying to excavations. Seeing the world. If I could leave school, I might actually learn something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that why you keep getting into trouble? Because your uncle and I have to work?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Every time you fly out of the country, you leave Molly and me behind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only during the school year,&#x201d; Aunt Delia countered.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m ready for more. I&#x2019;m almost thirteen. In some countries, I&#x2019;d be married by now!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Addison missed all his afternoon classes to hide in the library and read about Incan treasure,&#x201d; Molly put in helpfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Molly!&#x201d; hissed Addison.<br><br>&#x201c;Incan treasure?&#x201d; cried Aunt Delia.<br><br>&#x201c;Molly wants to get out of here, too. We&#x2019;re tired of being cooped up in school while you and Uncle Nigel trot around the globe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drag your sister into this, Addison. Molly&#x2014;unlike you&#x2014;has never broken a rule in her life. I refuse to believe she is longing for a life of adventure, when she can&#x2019;t even take the garbage down to the trash chute by herself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t, or won&#x2019;t?&#x201d; Addison replied.<br><br>Aunt Delia stepped out of her high heels, hung her coat in the closet, and set her briefcase down on the table with a clatter. She took a deep breath and ran a hand across her forehead. &#x201c;Addison, I will spend more time with you when the museum gets back on its feet. Until then, your uncle and I need to work hard so you and Molly have a roof to eat and food to sleep under.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you got that backward,&#x201d; Molly suggested.<br><br>Aunt Delia rubbed the dark bags under her eyes and sighed, exhausted. &#x201c;Addison, I don&#x2019;t have time to pick you up from after-school detentions. I don&#x2019;t have time for more soul-draining teacher meetings about you getting into trouble with Eddie and Raj.&#x201d;<br><br>Aunt Delia took Addison by his wrists and looked him in the eyes. &#x201c;There is only one of you, and only one of Molly. That makes each of you more rare and valuable than Incan gold. Do you understand why I&#x2019;m upset?&#x201d;<br><br>Addison nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t make rules just to be mean. I make rules to prevent you from being&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;kidnapped.&#x201d;<br><br>Addison nodded again, seeing the sense in this.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to stick together, all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Addison. &#x201c;Stick together. I promise.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Addison and Molly shared a bunk bed in their room of Aunt Delia&#x2019;s two-bedroom apartment. Molly&#x2019;s half of the room was strewn with mismatched socks, grass-stained soccer shorts, and mud-caked sports jerseys. Addison&#x2019;s half of the room was as pristine and immaculate as a NASA science lab.<br><br>Roosting pigeons cooed on the window ledge, watching the afternoon descend into night. Rising wind and brooding gray clouds betrayed a gathering storm.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do we have to stay with Uncle Nigel this weekend?&#x201d; Molly asked.<br><br>Addison packed clothes and books into his backpack. &#x201c;Because Aunt Delia&#x2019;s working.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But why do we have to stay with Uncle Nigel at the museum?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because Uncle Nigel&#x2019;s working.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are they always working?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like Aunt Delia said&#x2014;to take care of us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By ignoring us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More or less,&#x201d; said Addison.<br><br>He carefully packed his microscope and calligraphy pens. He swiped a pocket notebook off his desk drawer and tucked it in his jacket. His notebooks contained sketches of birds and mammals he observed in the park, as well as pressed leaves and beetles. Addison&#x2019;s uncle always needled him on the first rule of archaeology: record everything.<br><br>Molly collected socks from the floor and tossed them across the room, making...</p><h2>Cook Beautiful</h2><p><b>The debut cookbook from Athena Calderone, creator of EyeSwoon, with 100 seasonal recipes for meals as gorgeous as they are delicious.</b><br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Cook Beautiful</i>, Athena reveals the secrets to preparing and presenting unforgettable meals.

Every December 25, all over the world, people are going to church. They gather around Christmas trees. They bake treats. They cook meals for family and friends. They sing songs and open presents.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is everybody celebrating?<br> &nbsp;<br> Christmas is the birthday of Jesus. He was born more than two thousand years ago in the small town of Bethlehem. He was from a poor family and grew up to be a preacher. He talked about God and how people should live their lives. He became well-known, and his friends passed along stories about him. They shared his teachings with others.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesus&#x2019;s ideas became a movement. The movement started with only a handful of people. But it grew into one of the most important religions in the world&#x2014;Christianity. Christianity spread to all parts of the globe. Today, there are two billion Christians. They are from different backgrounds, different races, and different cultures, but they share common beliefs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christians believe in one God. They believe in Heaven, in life after death. They also believe that Jesus was much more than a preacher. They believe he was the son of God.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: A Humble Birth</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Jesus was born into a Jewish family over two thousand years ago. His father was a carpenter named Joseph. His mother was named Mary.<br> &nbsp;<br> According to the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel came to Mary months before Jesus&#x2019;s birth. &#x201c;Do not be afraid, Mary,&#x201d; the angel said, &#x201c;for you have found favor with God.&#x201d; He told her she was going to give birth to a special baby boy. The baby was the son of God, not the son of her husband, Joseph. Gabriel also told her the baby&#x2019;s name&#x2014;Jesus.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Joseph and Mary lived in a region ruled by the Romans and Emperor Augustus. It was called Judea. Right before Jesus was born, Joseph and Mary had to travel to the town of Bethlehem. The government wanted to register the names of all people living in the area.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Bethlehem, Mary gave birth to her son.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The family stayed in a stable, because the local inn had no room for them. Instead of a crib, Jesus slept in a manger. A manger is a wooden bin that holds food for horses and other animals.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a humble start. However, right away, people learned of this birth and knew the baby was special. According to the Gospel of Luke, shepherds in the fields saw an angel above them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am bringing you good news of great joy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; the angel said. He told them a baby had been born who would be the Messiah. <i>Messiah</i> is a word for a special person who will save people from great danger or harm.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Gospel of Matthew says that far away, in a country to the east, three wise men spotted a bright star in the sky. The wise men studied the heavens and understood the star was an important sign. It meant the Messiah had been born. So they followed the star to Bethlehem to see the baby Jesus.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the three wise men saw Mary and the baby Jesus, they fell to their knees. They brought him gifts, too&#x2014;gold, as well as frankincense and myrrh, which were costly spices.<br> &nbsp;<br> Herod, the king of Judea, also heard about Jesus. The news of Jesus&#x2019;s birth worried Herod. He asked the wise men to tell him where Jesus was. He told them he just wanted to see the baby, too. But after they had seen the child, a dream warned the wise men to not return to Herod, and instead they went home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Joseph, Mary&#x2019;s husband, also had a dream. It alerted him that Jesus was in danger. He took Mary and his son and fled at night into the country of Egypt.<br><br></p></p><h2>Before I Was Born: God Knew My Name (God&#39;s Design for Sex)</h2><p><b>One Million Copies Sold in Series!<br>Christian Book Award: ECPA Medallion of Excellence</b><br><br><i>Before I Was Born</i> emphasizes the creational goodness of our bodies, our existence as men and women, and our sexual organs.

She has won several writing awards, including The Children&#x2019;s Choice Award and The EdPress Award for Excellence in Children&#x2019;s Magazine Fiction. <p>Illustrator Lee Harper is a children&#x2019;s book author/illustrator living with his family in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Lee is the illustrator of <i>Woolbur</i> by Leslie Helakoski (HarperCollins 2008), <i>Turkey Trouble</i> by Wendi Silvano (Marshall Cavendish 2009), and <i>Snow! Snow! Snow!</i> which he both wrote and illustrated! (Simon and Schuster 2009) Besides writing and illustrating Lee loves to visit schools.</p>PreS-Gr 2-Having avoided being served up for Thanksgiving dinner in Turkey Trouble (Marshall Cavendish, 2009), the protagonist travels to the North Pole to petition Santa to save him from being the main attraction of Christmas dinner. Santa is too busy to see anyone, and Turkey's attempts to disguise himself as a Christmas tree, a reindeer, a candy cane, and Mrs. Claus fail hilariously. When he manages to smuggle himself into Santa's presence (wrapped up as a Christmas present), Santa comes up with the perfect plan-and the whole farm munches contentedly on Christmas pizza. Goofy watercolor and pencil illustrations play up the humor of the giggle-inducing text, with Turkey working his wattles to great effect. "Pizza on Earth" could indeed start a new tradition.-Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library &#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

She knows he will take good care of them. While he swims waiting for the eggs to hatch, he meets other underwater fathers caring for their babies. Now Eric Carle's heart-warming <i>New York Times</i> bestseller is finally available in a board book edition, complete with the clear "peek-a-boo" pages that made the original such a hit. Brimming with bright, colorful sea life, this new board book will be irresistable to young children everywhere.</p><p>Are you ready for a scintillating seahorse fact? The father seahorse is the one who carries the mother's eggs around in his pouch before they hatch. In <i>Mister Seahorse</i>, master collage artist Eric Carle teaches preschoolers this lesson and introduces them to a few other fish who bear the traditionally maternal burden of caring for eggs: the stickleback, tilapia, Kurtus nurseryfish (known here as Mr. Kurtus), pipefish, and bullhead catfish. As ever, it's Carle's art that steals the show. Cut-up tissue paper soaks up the watery paint and makes for a boldly colorful, almost jewel-like undersea journey. The story? Well, repetition is the heart of instruction, after all. <p> Most of Carle's books employ some sort of gizmo or gadget--and this one is no exception. Here, for a splendid lesson in camouflage, colorful acetate sheets mask marine life that is revealed as the child turns the page. Children may take comfort in the devotion of these undersea fathers...except perhaps at the very end when the father seahorse says to a freshly hatched sea-pony who wants back in the pouch: "I <i>do</i> love you, but now you are ready to be on your own." (Preschool) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Eric Carle is acclaimed and beloved as the creator of brilliantly illustrated and innovatively designed picture books for very young children. His best-known work, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the <b>Caterpillar</b> was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.<p> Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, Eric Carle moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old; he was educated there, and graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart. But his dream was always to return to America, the land of his happiest childhood memories. So, in 1952, with a fine portfolio in hand and forty dollars in his pocket, he arrived in New York. Soon he found a job as a graphic designer in the promotion department of <i>The New York Times</i>. Later, he was the art director of an advertising agency for many years. </p><p>One day, respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, called to ask Carle to illustrate a story he had written. Martin's eye had been caught by a striking picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. <b>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</b> was the result of their collaboration. It is still a favorite with children everywhere. This was the beginning of Eric Carle's true career. Soon Carle was writing his own stories, too. His first wholly original book was <b>1,2,3 to the Zoo</b>, followed soon afterward by the celebrated classic, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>. </p><p>Eric Carle's art is distinctive and instantly recognizable. His art work is created in collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images. Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p>Eric Carle has two grown-up children, a son and a daughter. With his wife Barbara, he lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.

The <i>Wicca Spellbook Starter Kit</i> from best-selling author Lisa Chamberlain offers three collections of spellwork focused on the powerful energies of candles, colors, crystals, mineral stones, and magical herbs.<br><br>Together, these books form a comprehensive grimoire of accessible, practical magic to help you further your own unique practice. Each Book of Shadows in this set expands on a form of magic covered in Lisa's three beginner guides, <i>Candle Magic</i>, <i>Crystal Magic</i>, and <i>Herbal Magic</i>. They can be used as companions to these guides, but they also stand on their own. The 160 magical workings within are designed for beginners and more advanced practitioners alike.<br><br><p><b>Book of Candle Spells</b></p><br><br><i>Book of Candle Spells</i> focuses on working with the Element of Fire, and the potent vibrational frequencies of the visible light spectrum. Candles take center stage to varying degrees across this collection. Some spells are focused exclusively on the combined magic of candle and color, while others incorporate additional tools such as crystals and other color-appropriate ingredients. The spells are also organized by color, with chapter introductions detailing the magical properties and uses for the 14 colors most widely used in Wiccan and other contemporary magic.<br><br><p><b>Book of Crystal Spells</b></p><br><br><i>Book of Crystal Spells</i> is devoted to the magical uses of the 13 crystals and other mineral stones introduced in Crystal Magic. Many of these spells are focused on aspects of emotional healing and energetic balancing, two purposes that crystals are uniquely suited for, but you&#x2019;ll also find more traditional goals represented, like prosperity, protection, and relationships. The spells are organized by stone, rather than by purpose, so you can develop a magical connection with different types of crystals, one at a time. You&#x2019;ll find an overview of the properties of each stone in the chapter introductions.<br><br><p><b>Book of Herbal Spells</b></p><br><br><i>Book of Herbal Spells</i> builds on the information from Herbal Magic, with a chapter for each of the 13 herbs featured in the original book. Single herbs are often the main focus of these spells, with minimal additional ingredients, to help you focus your attention on the subtle energies of the herbs themselves. As you work more and more with herbal magic, you will develop a natural affinity with these marvelous plant beings that have been co-creating with magical people since the beginning of time.<br><br><p><b>Magical Workings for Any Experience Level</b></p><br><br>The practice of magic is a lifelong path, with delightful and rewarding results that can transform our lives.

After the Civil War, Carver enrolled in classes and proved to be a star student. He became the first black student at Iowa State Agricultural College and later its first black professor. He went on to the Tuskegee Institute where he specialized in botany (the study of plants) and developed techniques to grow crops better. His work with vegetables, especially peanuts, made him famous and changed agriculture forever. He went on to develop nearly 100 household products and over 100 recipes using peanuts.</p><p>Jim Gigliotti is a freelance writer based in Southern California. A former editor at the National Football League, he has written more than 50 books for all ages. His writing credits include biographies for young readers on Olympian Jesse Owens and baseball star Roberto Clemente.<p>Who Was George Washington Carver?<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Baynham looked out at her garden, but she didn&#x2019;t like what she saw. Mrs. Baynham lived in the biggest house in Diamond Grove, Missouri, in the mid-1870s. Inside the house, everything was in order: pretty paintings and nice furniture. But outside, in the garden, her roses weren&#x2019;t blooming.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Why not? </i>she wondered. Her friend Susan Carver&#x2019;s roses were blooming. Her roses were big and beautiful&#x2014;and bright red! Mrs. Carver lived on a nearby farm. Mrs. Baynham went over and asked what her secret was to growing such perfect flowers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s our George,&#x201d; Mrs. Carver said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the one who knows about roses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> George was the ten-year-old boy who lived with Mrs. Carver. She was his foster mother. Mrs. Carver had been taking care of George since he was a baby. And George had been taking care of Mrs. Carver&#x2019;s plants and flowers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Actually, George helped out around the farm in many ways. He loved Mrs. Carver as if she were his own mother. He would have done just about anything she asked. But he was especially happy when she asked him to help with her garden.<br> &nbsp;<br> So George went over to Mrs. Baynham&#x2019;s house to take a look at her roses. He knew right away what was wrong.&nbsp;Her roses needed to be moved to a different part of the garden, where they could get more sun. He moved the plants, and soon they were in full bloom!<br> &nbsp;<br> Word spread quickly. And young George started helping many of Mrs. Carver&#x2019;s friends<br> with their plants and flowers. One week, a neighbor needed help with her lilies. Another week, a friend asked for help with her begonias. George always seemed to know how to fix whatever problem there was. Soon, he became known as &#x201c;the Plant Doctor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> George never lost that helpful spirit, nor his love for plants and the best way to grow them. He was George Washington Carver, and he used his passion for nature to become one of the most famous, and helpful, scientists in the world.<br><br></p></p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s The Gingerbread Man (Little Golden Book)</h2><p><b>A classic children's story illustrated by the great Richard Scarry!&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;Run, run, as fast as you can!&#x201d; Catch Richard Scarry&#x2019;s gingerbread man as he tears through this beloved Little Golden Book, originally published in 1953 and every bit as enchanting today.

See RED and NED and TED and ED in BED. And giggle as PAT sits on a HAT and a CAT and a BAT&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and almost on a cactus! (NO PAT NO, don&#x2019;t sit on that.) A perfect gift for baby showers, birthdays, and happy occasions of all kinds, it is also a great way to show Pop some love on Father&#x2019;s Day!</p></p><p>First published in 1963, <i>Hop on Pop</i> remains a perennial favorite when it comes to teaching kids to read. Here, as in most of his extensive body of work, Dr. Seuss creates uncomplicated, monosyllabic rhymes to foster learning and inspire children to read. But what was radical about this little book at the time of publication (and what makes it still compelling today) is Seuss's departure from the traditionally dull pictures and sentences used in reading primers. In contrast, the illustrations here are wild and wonderful, and the accompanying language, while simple, is delightfully silly. For example, the rhyme "THREE TREE / Three fish in a tree / Fish in a tree? / How can that be?" is brought to life with a trio of plump, self-satisfied fish perched atop globular branches as two stymied hybrid dog-rabbit-humanoids look on in consternation. <i>Hop on Pop</i> does much more than teach children the basics of word construction, it also introduces them to the incomparable pleasure of reading a book. <i>(Ages Baby to Preschooler)</i>This is one of the books of the &#39;Beginner Books&#39; series, which by exacting blends of words and pictures encourage children to read all by themselves. Hailed by elementary educators and remedial reading specialists, these enormously popular books are now used in schools and libraries throughout the English-speaking world.</p><h2>The Velveteen Rabbit Hardcover: The Classic Edition by The New York Times Bestselling Illustrator, Charles Santore (Charles Santore Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Engaging new illustrations by renowned artist Charles Santore&#x2014;illustrator of The Night Before Christmas, The Wizard of Oz, Snow White, and many others&#x2014;reinvigorate the classic children&#x2019;s story of the Velveteen Rabbit.

Reading <em>Astronomy for Kids</em> makes me sorry that a book like this was not introduced to me as a young person. Dr. Betts explains things in a step-wise fashion in words everyone can understand, allowing young and old to become competent night sky observers. The book proceeds from naked-eye viewing through the use of binoculars and a telescope, allowing the reader to see more and more according to their deepening interest. There are gorgeous images of planets and stars, clear directions on how to locate them, and seasonal maps of constellations and key stars. I also appreciated the references and guides to free associated learning materials.

Shannon remembers the word "no" all too clearly from his childhood, and, as he says in his introduction, "It seems that kids haven't changed much over the years, and neither have school rules, some of which date back even further than the invention of sneakers." In <i>David Goes to School</i>, young David shows up late to class, goes wacko at the blackboard, chews gum in class, yells answers out of turn, pulls pigtails, stares out the window, cuts in line, has a food fight ("I don't care who started it!" says the teacher), lingers at recess, and draws on his desk. Colorful, hilarious, childlike illustrations examine our strangely appealing demon-boy at eye level, which is especially disgusting as David stretches an enormous mass of bubble gum from his pointy-toothed maw. After an intense day of exuberant misbehaving, however, he stays after school and washes all the desks until they sparkle. The day ends with a gold star and a pat on the head... something that any child (or adult) would find satisfying. (Click to see a sample spread. Copyright 1999 by David Shannon.

This is the book Tom Zuba wishes he had read after his daughter Erin died. And after his wife Trici died. It&#39;s the book he wishes he&#39;d been handed following his son Rory&#39;s death. But Tom had to live it. First. Before he could write it. For you. In the beginning, Tom did grief the old way. Repressing, denying, pretending, numbing and stuffing every feeling and every emotion that arose. He created pain on top of pain until he began searching for a new way. A new way to do grief. Once he gave himself permission to mourn, healing began. Along the way, Tom discovered that: * Grief is not the enemy. Grief can be one of our greatest teachers. * It&#39;s the stories we tell that determine whether or not we will heal. * We will always have a relationship with the people we love that have died. * We were not born to suffer. We were born to be radiant. There is a new way to do grief.

It&#x2019;s about encouraging them to open their minds to new challenges, to new opportunities, to who they already are and all they can become. It&#x2019;s about giving them a Yes Brain.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve heard Dan speak, you may have participated in an exercise where he asks his audience to close their eyes and pay attention to their bodily and emotional responses when he repeats a particular word. He begins by somewhat harshly saying &#x201c;no&#x201d; over and over again. He repeats it seven times, then switches to &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; which he says much more gently, again and again. He then asks the audience members to open their eyes and describe what they experienced. They report that the &#x201c;no&#x201d; portion of the exercise left them feeling shut down, upset, tense, and defensive, whereas when Dan repeated the affirming &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; they felt open, calm, relaxed, and lighter. The muscles of their face and vocal cords relaxed, their breathing and heart rate normalized, and they became more open, as opposed to restricted or insecure or oppositional. (Feel free to close your eyes now and try the exercise for yourself. Maybe enlist the help of a relative or friend. Notice what goes on in your body as you repeatedly hear the word &#x201c;no,&#x201d; and then &#x201c;yes.&#x201d;)<br><br>These two different responses&#x2014;�the &#x201c;yes&#x201d; response and the &#x201c;no&#x201d; response&#x2014;�give you an idea of what we mean when we talk about a Yes Brain, as well as its opposite, a No Brain. If you expand that and think about it as an overall outlook on life, a No Brain leaves you feeling reactive when you interact with people, which makes it nearly impossible to listen, make good decisions, or connect with and care for another person. A focus on survival and self-�defense kicks into gear, leaving you feeling guarded and shut down when it comes to interacting with the world and learning new lessons. Your nervous system initiates its reactive fight-�flight-�freeze-�or-�faint response: fight means lashing out, flight means escaping, freeze means temporarily immobilizing yourself, and faint means collapsing and feeling utterly helpless. Any of these four reactive responses to threat can become triggered, preventing you from being open, connecting to others, and offering flexible responses. That&#x2019;s the reactive No Brain state.<br><br>The Yes Brain, in contrast, emerges from different circuits in the brain that become activated and lead to receptivity rather than reactivity. Scientists use the term &#x201c;social engagement system&#x201d; to refer to the set of neural circuits that help us connect openly with others&#x2014;�and even our own inner experience. As a result of receptivity and an active social engagement system, we feel much more capable of addressing challenges in a strong, clear, and flexible way. In this Yes Brain state, we open ourselves to a sense of equanimity and harmony, allowing us to absorb, assimilate, and learn from new information.<br><br>This Yes Brain mindset is what we want for our kids, so that they learn to view obstacles and new experiences not as paralyzing impediments but simply as challenges to be faced and overcome and learned from. When kids work from a Yes Brain mentality, they&#x2019;re more flexible, more open to compromise, more willing to take chances and explore. They&#x2019;re more curious and imaginative, less worried about making mistakes. They&#x2019;re also less rigid and stubborn, which makes them better at relationships and more adaptable and resilient when it comes to handling adversity. They understand themselves and work from a clear internal compass that directs their decisions as well as the way they treat others. Guided by their Yes Brain, they do more, learn more, and become more. They say yes to the world from a place of emotional equilibrium, welcoming all that life offers&#x2014;�even when circumstances don&#x2019;t go their way.<br><br>Our opening message to you is a thrilling one: you have the power to promote this type of flexibility, receptivity, and resilience in your children. This is what we mean by mental strength&#x2014;�giving your kids a strong mind. Not by making them attend a lecture series on grit and curiosity, or by initiating lots of long, intense, stare-�into-�each-�other&#x2019;s-�eyes conversations. In fact, your everyday interactions with your children are all you need. Simply by keeping in mind the Yes Brain principles and lessons we&#x2019;ll show you in the coming pages, you can use the time you spend with your kids&#x2014;�while driving to school, eating dinner, playing together, or even arguing with them&#x2014;�to influence the way they respond to their circumstances and interact with the people around them.<br><br>That&#x2019;s because a Yes Brain is more than just a mindset or an approach to the world. It&#x2019;s that, definitely. And as such, it gives your child an internal guide to help him or her face life&#x2019;s challenges with security and enthusiasm. It&#x2019;s the basis of being strong from the inside out. But a Yes Brain is also a neurological state that emerges when the brain is engaged in certain ways. By understanding a few basic details about brain development, you can help create an environment that provides opportunities that will foster a Yes Brain in your kids.<br><br>As we&#x2019;ll explain below, the Yes Brain is created by neural activity that involves a particular region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, an area that links many regions with one another, handles higher-�order thinking, and facilitates curiosity, resilience, compassion, insight, open-�mindedness, problem-�solving, and even morality. Kids can learn to increasingly access and pay attention to the functions of this part of the brain as they grow and develop. In other words, you can teach your kids how to grow this important neural area that supports mental strength. As a result, they can control their emotions and bodies better, while also listening more carefully to their inner promptings and being more fully themselves. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re talking about when we discuss the Yes Brain: a neurological state that helps children (and adults) approach the world with openness, resilience, empathy, and authenticity.<br><br>A No Brain, in contrast, emerges less from the interconnecting prefrontal cortex and more from a less integrated brain state that involves the activity of lower, more primitive regions of the brain. This No Brain state is how we respond to a threat or get ready for an impending attack. As a result, it&#x2019;s intensely reactive, defensively worrying that it might make a mistake or that curiosity might lead to some kind of trouble. And this state can go on the offense, too, pushing back on new knowledge and fighting off input from others. Attacking and rejecting are two ways the No Brain deals with the world. The No Brain&#x2019;s outlook on the world is one of stubbornness, anxiety, competition, and threat, leaving it much less capable of handling difficult situations or achieving a clear understanding of self or others.<br><br>Kids who approach the world from a No Brain state are at the mercy of their circumstances and their feelings. They get stuck in their emotions, unable to shift them, and they complain about their realities rather than finding healthy ways to respond to them. They worry, often obsessively, about facing something new or making a mistake, rather than making decisions in a Yes Brain spirit of openness and curiosity. Stubbornness often rules the day in a No Brain state.<br><br>Does any of that sound similar to your situation at home? If you have kids, it probably does. The truth is, we all get into No Brain states&#x2014;�kids and adults alike. Becoming rigid and/or reactive from time to time is something we can&#x2019;t completely avoid. But we can understand it. Then we can learn ways to help our kids return more quickly to a Yes Brain state when they leave it. And more important, we can give them the tools to do so themselves. Young children will work from a No Brain state more often than older children and adults. A seemingly omnipresent No Brain is typical and developmentally appropriate for a three-�year-�old&#x2014;�like when she cries with fury because her harmonica got wet, even though she&#x2019;s the one who threw it in the sink full of water! But over time, and as development unfolds, we can support our kids in developing the ability to regulate themselves, bounce back from difficulties, understand their own �experiences, and be thoughtful of others. Then, more and more, the no becomes a yes.<br><br>Think about that right now, for just a moment. How would life at your house change if your kids were better at responding to everyday situations&#x2014;�conflict with siblings, turning off electronics, following directions, homework struggles, bedtime battles&#x2014;�from a Yes Brain instead of reacting from a No Brain? What would be different if they were less rigid and stubborn and they could better regulate themselves when things don&#x2019;t go their way? What if they welcomed new experiences instead of fearing them? What if they could be clearer about their own feelings, and more caring and empathic toward others? How much happier would they be? How much happier and more peaceful would the whole family be?<br><br>That&#x2019;s what this book is about: helping develop a Yes Brain in your kids by giving them the space, the opportunity, and the tools to develop into people who openly engage with their world and become fully and authentically themselves. This is how we help children develop mental strength and resilience.<br><br>Nurturing a Yes Brain Is Not About Being Permissive<br><br>Let us be clear from the outset about what the Yes Brain is not. The Yes Brain is not about telling kids yes all the time. It&#x2019;s not about being permissive, or giving in, or protecting them from disappointment, or rescuing them from difficult situations. Nor is it about creating a compliant child who robotically minds his parents without thinking for himself. Instead, it&#x2019;s about helping kids begin to realize who they are and who they are becoming, and that they can overcome disappointment and defeat and choose a life full of connection and meaning. Chapters 2 and 3 especially will discuss the importance of allowing children to understand that frustrations and setbacks are an inherent part of life&#x2014;�and supporting them while they learn that lesson.<br><br>After all, the result of a Yes Brain is not a person who is happy all the time or who never experiences any problems or negative feelings. That&#x2019;s not the point at all. It&#x2019;s not the goal of life, nor is it possible. The Yes Brain leads not to some sort of perfection or paradise, but to the ability to find joy and meaning even in the midst of life&#x2019;s challenges. It allows a person to feel grounded and understand themselves, to flexibly learn and adapt, and to live with a sense of purpose. It leads them not only to survive difficult situations, but to emerge from them stronger and wiser. That&#x2019;s how they can develop meaning in their lives. From their Yes Brain they&#x2019;re also able to engage with their inner life, with others, and with the world. That&#x2019;s what we mean by having a life of connection and knowing who we are.<br><br>When kids and adolescents also develop the ability for equanimity&#x2014;�for learning the skill of returning to a Yes Brain state after being in No Brain mode&#x2014;�we&#x2019;ve given them an important components of resilience. The ancient Greeks had a term for this kind of happiness composed of meaning, connection, and peaceful contentedness. They called it eudaimonia, and it&#x2019;s one of the most empowering and lasting gifts we can give our children. It helps create the kind of successful life we can prepare our kids for if we allow them to mature into their own individual identities while supporting them and building skills along the way. And, of course, by working on our own Yes Brain.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s face it: in many ways kids are growing up in a No Brain world. Think about a traditional school day, full of rules and regulations, standardized tests, rote memorization, and one-�size-�fits-�all discipline techniques. Whew! And they have to deal with that six hours a day, five days a week, for nine months of the year? Yikes. On top of that, consider the oh-�so-�packed schedules so many of us impose on them, full of &#x201c;enrichment&#x201d; classes and tutoring and other activities that leave them staying up late and losing sleep because they have to get their homework done because they couldn&#x2019;t do it during the daylight hours since they were so busy being &#x201c;enriched.&#x201d; When we add to this how compelling digital media has become, with auditory and visual stimuli capturing our kids&#x2019; attention around the clock with a temporary pleasure the Greeks called hedonia, we can realize that cultivating a Yes Brain is especially important in these modern times to empower our kids with true and lasting happiness, with the eudaimonia of meaning, connection, and equanimity.<br><br>These digital distractions and busy schedules are often experiences that fail to ignite&#x2014;�and at times even undermine&#x2014;�Yes Brain thought. Some of them may actually offer enriching experiences, and some may be necessary evils (although we&#x2019;re not convinced how necessary certain commonly accepted educational practices really are, as evidenced by the inspirational work being done all over the country and the world by educators who are challenging the status quo in the areas of homework, class schedules, and discipline). Yes, of course kids need to learn about managing routines, following a calendar, and completing tasks that aren&#x2019;t necessarily pleasant or fun. You&#x2019;ll hear us endorse that idea throughout the book. Our main point here is simply that when you consider how many of a child&#x2019;s waking hours are spent doing No Brain work or engaged in No Brain activities, it becomes that much more important that we strive to offer them Yes Brain interactions whenever we possibly can. We want to make home a place where a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; approach is consistently emphasized and prioritized.</p><h2>Animal Farm: The Graphic Novel</h2><p><b>A beautiful graphic adaptation of George Orwell's timeless and timely allegorical novel.</b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.</i>&#x201d;<br><br> In 1945, George Orwell, called &#x201c;the conscience of his generation,&#x201d; created an enduring, devastating story of new tyranny replacing old, and power corrupting even the noblest of causes.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. THE RED CARPET</b></p> <p>There are moments of great luxury in the life of a secret agent. There are assignments on which he is required to act the part of a very rich man; occasions when he takes refuge in good living to efface the memory of danger and the shadow of death; and times when, as was now the case, he is a guest in the territory of an allied Secret Service.</p> <p>From the moment the BOAC Stratocruiser taxied up to the International Air Terminal at Idlewild, James Bond was treated like royalty.</p> <p>When he left the aircraft with the other passengers he had resigned himself to the notorious purgatory of the US Health, Immigration and Customs machinery. At least an hour, he thought, of overheated, drab-green rooms smelling of last year's air and stale sweat and guilt and the fear that hangs round all frontiers, fear of those closed doors marked PRIVATE that hide the careful men, the files, the teleprinters chattering urgently to Washington, to the Bureau of Narcotics, Counter Espionage, the Treasury, the FBI.</p> <p>As he walked across the tarmac in the bitter January wind he saw his own name going over the network: BOND, JAMES. BRITISH DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT 0094567, the short wait and the replies coming back on the different machines: NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE. And then, from the FBI: POSITIVE AWAIT CHECK. There would be some hasty traffic on the FBI circuit with the Central Intelligence Agency and then: FBI TO IDLEWILD: BOND OKAY OKAY, and the bland official out front would hand him back his passport with a 'Hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>Bond shrugged his shoulders and followed the other passengers through the wire fence towards the door marked US HEALTH SERVICE.</p> <p>In his case it was only a boring routine, of course, but he disliked the idea of his dossier being in the possession of any foreign power. Anonymity was the chief tool of his trade. Every thread of his real identity that went on record in any file diminished his value and, ultimately, was a threat to his life. Here in America, where they knew all about him, he felt like a negro whose shadow has been stolen by the witch-doctor. A vital part of himself was in pawn, in the hands of others. Friends, of course, in this instance, but still . . .</p> <p>'Mr Bond?'</p> <p>A pleasant-looking nondescript man in plain clothes had stepped forward from the shadow of the Health Service building.</p> <p>'My name's Halloran. Pleased to meet you!'</p> <p>They shook hands.</p> <p>'Hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you follow me, please?'</p> <p>He turned to the officer of the Airport police on guard at the door.</p> <p>'Okay, Sergeant.' 'Okay, Mr Halloran. Be seeing you.'</p> <p>The other passengers had passed inside. Halloran turned to the left, away from the building. Another policeman held open a small gate in the high boundary fence.</p> <p>'Bye, Mr Halloran.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Bye, Officer. Thanks.'</p> <p>Directly outside a black Buick waited, its engine sighing quietly. They climbed in. Bond's two light suitcases were in front next to the driver. Bond couldn't imagine how they had been extracted so quickly from the mound of passengers' luggage he had seen only minutes before being trolleyed over to Customs.</p> <p>'Okay, Grady. Let's go.'</p> <p>Bond sank back luxuriously as the big limousine surged forward, slipping quickly into top through the Dynaflow gears.</p> <p>He turned to Halloran.</p> <p>'Well, that's certainly one of the reddest carpets I've ever seen. I expected to be at least an hour getting through Immigration. Who laid it on? I'm not used to VIP treatment. Anyway, thanks very much for your part in it all.'</p> <p>'You're very welcome, Mr Bond.' Halloran smiled and offered him a cigarette from a fresh pack of Luckies. 'We want to make your stay comfortable. Anything you want, just say so and it's yours. You've got some good friends in Washington. I don't myself know why you're here but it seems the authorities are keen that you should be a privileged guest of the Government. It's my job to see you get to your hotel as quickly and as comfortably as possible and then I'll hand over and be on my way. May I have your passport a moment, please.'</p> <p>Bond gave it to him. Halloran opened a briefcase on the seat beside him and took out a heavy metal stamp. He turned the pages of Bond's passport until he came to the US Visa, stamped it, scribbled his signature over the dark blue circle of the Department of Justice cypher and gave it back to him. Then he took out his pocket-book and extracted a thick white envelope which he gave to Bond.</p> <p>'There's a thousand dollars in there, Mr Bond.' He held up his hand as Bond started to speak. 'And it's Communist money we took in the Schmidt-Kinaski haul. We're using it back at them and you are asked to co-operate and spend this in any way you like on your present assignment. I am advised that it will be considered a very unfriendly act if you refuse. Let's please say no more about it and,' he added, as Bond continued to hold the envelope dubiously in his hand, 'I am also to say that the disposal of this money through your hands has the knowledge and approval of your own Chief.'</p> <p>Bond eyed him narrowly and then grinned. He put the envelope away in his notecase.</p> <p>'All right,' he said. 'And thanks. I'll try and spend it where it does most harm. I'm glad to have some working capital. It's certainly good to know it's been provided by the opposition.'</p> <p>'Fine,' said Halloran; 'and now, if you'll forgive me, I'll just write up my notes for the report I'll have to put in. Have to remember to get a letter of thanks sent to Immigration and Customs and so forth for their co-operation. Routine.'</p> <p>'Go ahead,' said Bond. He was glad to keep silent and gaze out at his first sight of America since the war. It was no waste of time to start picking up the American idiom again: the advertisements, the new car models and the prices of second-hand ones in the used-car lots; the exotic pungency of the road signs: SOFT SHOULDERS - SHARP CURVES - SQUEEZE AHEAD - SLIPPERY WHEN WET; the standard of driving; the number of women at the wheel, their menfolk docilely beside them; the men's clothes; the way the women were doing their hair; the Civil Defence warnings: IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK - KEEP MOVING - GET OFF BRIDGE; the thick rash of television aerials and the impact of TV on hoardings and shop windows; the occasional helicopter; the public appeals for cancer and polio funds: THE MARCH OF DIMES - all the small, fleeting impressions that were as important to his trade as are broken bark and bent twigs to the trapper in the jungle.</p> <p>The driver chose the Triborough Bridge and they soared across the breath-taking span into the heart of uptown Manhattan, the beautiful prospect of New York hastening towards them until they were down amongst the hooting, teeming, petrol-smelling roots of the stressed-concrete jungle.</p> <p>Bond turned to his companion.</p> <p>'I hate to say it,' he said, 'but this must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the globe.'</p> <p>'Nothing to touch it,' agreed Halloran. 'Keeps me awake nights thinking what would happen.'</p> <p>They drew up at the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street. A saturnine middle-aged man in a dark blue overcoat and black homburg came forward behind the commissionaire. On the sidewalk, Halloran introduced him.</p> <p>'Mr Bond, meet Captain Dexter.' He was deferential. 'Can I pass him along to you now, Captain?'</p> <p>'Sure, sure. Just have his bags sent up. Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go ahead with Mr Bond and see he has everything he wants.'</p> <p>Bond turned to say good-bye to Halloran and thank him. For a moment Halloran had his back to him as he said something about Bond's luggage to the commissionaire. Bond looked past him across 55th Street. His eyes narrowed. A black sedan, a Chevrolet, was pulling sharply out into the thick traffic, right in front of a Checker cab that braked hard, its driver banging his fist down on the horn and holding it there. The sedan kept going, just caught the tail of the green light, and disappeared north up Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>It was a smart, decisive bit of driving, but what startled Bond was that it had been a negress at the wheel, a fine-looking negress in a black chauffeur's uniform, and through the rear window he had caught a glimpse of the single passenger - a huge grey-black face which had turned slowly towards him and looked directly back at him, Bond was sure of it, as the car accelerated towards the Avenue.</p> <p>Bond shook Halloran by the hand. Dexter touched his elbow impatiently.</p> <p>'We'll go straight in and through the lobby to the elevators. Half-right across the lobby. And would you please keep your hat on, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>As Bond followed Dexter up the steps into the hotel he reflected that it was almost certainly too late for these precautions. Hardly anywhere in the world will you find a negress driving a car. A negress acting as a chauffeur is still more extraordinary. Barely conceivable even in Harlem, but that was certainly where the car was from.</p> <p>And the giant shape in the back seat? That grey-black face? Mister Big?</p> <p>'Hm,' said Bond to himself as he followed the slim back of Captain Dexter into the elevator.</p> <p>The elevator slowed up for the twenty-first floor.</p> <p>'We've got a little surprise ready for you, Mr Bond,' said Captain Dexter, without, Bond thought, much enthusiasm.</p> <p>They walked down the corridor to the corner room.</p> <p>The wind sighed outside the passage windows and Bond had a fleeting view of the tops of other skyscrapers and, beyond, the stark fingers of the trees in Central Park. He felt far out of touch with the ground and for a moment a strange feeling of loneliness and empty space gripped his heart.</p> <p>Dexter unlocked the door of No. 2100 and shut it behind them. They were in a small lighted lobby. They left their hats and coats on a chair and Dexter opened the door in front of...</p></p><h2>Kid Chef Junior: My First Kids&#39; Cookbook</h2><p><p><strong>The family that cooks together stays together &#x2015; here's the cookbook that introduces kids to the kitchen.</strong></p><p>Children are naturally curious about what goes on in the kitchen, and are eager to step up to the counter themselves. <em>Kid Chef Junior: My First Kids Cookbook</em> will help kids develop their culinary know-how as they make healthy, wholesome, kid-approved meals&#x2015;first with an adult, and eventually, all on their own!</p><p>In this kids cookbook, mom of two and author of <em>The Super Easy Baby Food Cookbook</em>, Anjali Shah, teaches children how to chop, whisk, bake, and cook on the stove.

(Richard Jackson Book)</h2><p>Margaret shares her secrets and her spirituality in this iconic Judy Blume novel, beloved by millions, that now has a fresh new look.<br><br>Margaret Simon, almost twelve, likes long hair, tuna fish, the smell of rain, and things that are pink. She&#x2019;s just moved from New York City to Farbook, New Jersey, and is anxious to fit in with her new friends&#x2014;Nancy, Gretchen, and Janie. When they form a secret club to talk about private subjects like boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret is happy to belong.<br> <br>But none of them can believe Margaret doesn&#x2019;t have religion, and that she isn&#x2019;t going to the Y or the Jewish Community Center. What they don&#x2019;t know is Margaret has her own very special relationship with God. She can talk to God about everything&#x2014;family, friends, even Moose Freed, her secret crush.<br> <br>Margaret is funny and real, and her thoughts and feelings are oh-so-relatable&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll feel like she&#x2019;s talking right to you, sharing her secrets with a friend.</p><p>If anyone tried to determine the most common rite of passage for preteen girls in North America, a girl's first reading of <i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</i> would rank near the top of the list. Judy Blume and her character Margaret Simon were the first to say out loud (and in a book even) that it is normal for girls to wonder when they are <i>ever</i> going to fill out their training bras. Puberty is a curious and annoying time. Girls' bodies begin to do freakish things--or, as in Margaret's case, they don't do freakish things nearly as fast as girls wish they would. Adolescents are often so relieved to discover that someone understands their body-angst that they miss one of the book's deeper explorations: a young person's relationship with God. Margaret has a very private relationship with God, and it's only after she moves to New Jersey and hangs out with a new friend that she discovers that it might be weird to talk to God without a priest or a rabbi to mediate. Margaret just wants to fit in! Who is God, and where is He when she needs Him? She begins to look into the cups of her training bra for answers ...For Margaret, everything is different this year. She&#39;s just moved from New York City to the suburbs and is anxious to fit in with her new friends--Nancy, Gretchen, and Janie. When they form a secret club to talk about private subjects like boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret is happy to belong. But in Farbrook, everybody joins the Y or the Jewish Community Center. Margaret doesn&#39;t have a religion, so what&#39;s she supposed to do? Suddenly life is very confusing. Maybe it&#39;s all part of growing up, but Margaret could really use some answers.</p><h2>The Whispering Oak: A Branches Book (The Last Firehawk #3) (3)</h2><p><b>Travel along with Tag, Skyla, and Blaze as they continue their search for the Ember Stone, in this series full of adventure, powerful dark magic, and fantasy! </b><br><br>Pick a book.

Soon dubbed the "New Look," it grabbed headlines all over the world and turned Dior into one of the most influential brands of all time. After the couturier's untimely death in 1957, Yves Saint Laurent took the helm of the fashion house before being succeeded by Marc Bohan, who was in turn replaced by Gianfranco Ferr� in 1989. In 1996, John Galliano was appointed creative director, designing flamboyant collections for a decade, before the arrival of Raf Simon in 2012, who gave the house a newly imagined identity for the 21st century. Maria Grazia Chiuri's arrival in 2017 as the&nbsp;first woman designer in Dior's history also marks&nbsp;the seventieth anniversary of the "New Look."&nbsp;<br><br> For the first time, every Dior haute couture collection is gathered here in a single, lavishly illustrated volume--providing a unique opportunity to chart the development of one of the world's most famous fashion brands and to discover rarely seen collections. &nbsp;<i>Dior: The Complete Collections</i> opens with a concise history of the house of Dior before exploring the collections themselves, which are organized chronologically. Each new "era" in Dior's history is inaugurated by a brief overview and biography of the new designer, while individual collections are introduced by a short text unveiling their influences and highlights and illustrated with carefully curated catwalk images.

Will the snow globe family get a chance to go sledding, too?</p><p><b>Jane O'Connor</b> lives in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;Old-fashioned illustrations, the appeal of dolls, and glitter on the cover cannot save this marginal effort that lacks both tension and logic. On the mantle of a Victorian family's home stands a snow globe. Inside it is another Victorian-looking, although doll-like, family. All they want is for someone to shake the globe so they can have a blizzard. But no one notices them, except Baby. One day, during a storm, the live family goes out to play, leaving the baby and her mother behind. The child climbs up to the mantle, takes down the object that captures her attention, and causes a blizzard inside. Then Mama decides that the snow is too wonderful to miss and takes Baby outside. Both families enjoy the elements, and the snow globe is returned to the mantle, but now the cat is creeping up on it.... The text is simple and somewhat disconnected, and the art, while attractive, will have limited appeal. The odd premise and lack of real excitement are unlikely to capture a young audience.<i>&#x2013;Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the months and years that follow during the late 1950s-early 1960s, Francisco, his mother and father, and his seven brothers and sister not only struggle to keep their family together, but also face crushing poverty, long hours of labor, and blatant prejudice. How they sustain their hope, their good-heartedness, and tenacity is revealed in this moving, Pura Belpr� Honor-winning sequel to <i>The Circuit.</i> Without bitterness or sentimentality, Francisco Jim�nez finishes telling the story of his youth.</p><p>Francisco Jim�nez emigrated from Tlaquepaque, Mexico, to California, where he worked for many years in the fields with his family. He received both his master's degree and his Ph.D. from Columbia University and is now the professor emeritus in the Modern Languages and LiteratureDepartment at Santa Clara University, the setting of much of his novel,&nbsp;<i>Reaching Out. He is the award-winning author of <i>The Circuit, <i>Cajas de carton, Breaking Through, <i>Senderos fronterizos, Mas Alla de mi, </i><i>Taking Hold,</i> <i>The Christmas Gift/El Regalo de la Navidad </i>and&nbsp;<em>La Mariposa</em></i></i><em><em>. </em></em></i><em>He is the recipient of many national literary awards, among them arethe John Steinbeck Award, the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, the Americas Award the Pura Belpr� Honor Book Award, the Tom�s Rivera BookAward, Reading the World Award, and the Carter C. Woodson National Book Award. He lives with his family&nbsp;in Santa Clara, California</em>Jim�nez' autobiographical story The Circuit (1997) broke new ground with its drama of a Mexican American migrant child in southern California. It won many prizes and was a Booklist Editors' Choice. This moving sequel is a fictionalized memoir of Jimenez's teenage years in the late 1950s, when the family finally stayed in one place and Francisco and his brothers worked long hours before and after school to put food on the table. First they picked strawberries in the fields. Later the jobs got better: cleaning offices, washing windows and walls, waxing floors. The prose here is not as taut as in the first book, but Jimenez writes with simplicity about a harsh world seldom seen in children's books. He also writes about a scary, sad, furious, and broken father--like the father in Na's A Step from Heaven [BKL Je 1 &amp; 15 01]. He stays true to the viewpoint of a teenager growing up poor: the yearning (What would it be like to live in a house, rather than the crowded barracks?); the ignorance (College?); the hurt of prejudice. Yet he celebrates his Mexican roots even as he learns to be an American. The images are powerful, especially the one of the boy cleaning offices before dawn, with notes of English words to memorize in his shirt pocket. An excellent choice for ESL classes, this is a book for many readers, who may discover an America they didn't know was here.<br></p><h2>How Linux Works, 3rd Edition: What Every Superuser Should Know</h2><p><b><b>Best selling guide to the inner workings of the Linux operating system with over 50,000 copies sold since its release in 2014.

No crowded malls, no corny office parties, no fruitcakes, no unwanted presents. That&#x2019;s just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they&#x2019;ll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on Hemlock Street without a rooftop Frosty, they won&#x2019;t be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash, they aren&#x2019;t even going to have a tree. They won&#x2019;t need one, because come December 25 they&#x2019;re setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas brings enormous consequences&#x2014;and isn&#x2019;t half as easy as they&#x2019;d imagined.<br><br>A classic tale for modern times, <i>Skipping Christmas</i> offers a hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that have become part of our holiday tradition.</p><p>John Grisham turns a satirical eye on the overblown ritual of the festive holiday season, and the result is <i>Skipping Christmas</i>, a modest but funny novel about the tyranny of December 25. Grisham's story revolves around a typical middle-aged American couple, Luther and Nora Krank. On the first Sunday after Thanksgiving they wave their daughter Blair off to Peru to work for the Peace Corps, and they suddenly realize that "for the first time in her young and sheltered life Blair would spend Christmas away from home."<p> Luther Krank sees his daughter's Christmas absence as an opportunity. He estimates that "a year earlier, the Luther Krank family had spent $6,100 on Christmas," and have "precious little to show for it." So he makes an executive decision, telling his wife, friends, and neighbors that "we won't do Christmas." Instead, Luther books a 10-day Caribbean cruise. But things start to turn nasty when horrified neighbors get wind of the Krank's subversive scheme and besiege the couple with questions about their decision.</p><p> Grisham builds up a funny but increasingly terrifying picture of how this tight-knit community turns on the Kranks, who find themselves under increasing pressure to conform. As the tension mounts, readers may wonder whether they will manage to board their plane on Christmas day. <i>Skipping Christmas</i> is Grisham-lite, with none of the serious action or drama of his legal thrillers, but a funny poke at the craziness of Christmas. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>This is a limited edition, cloth bound book, that is signed by the author and numbered. The book is included in a cloth slipcase. There are 350 copies of this edition of <i>Skipping Christmas</i> available worldwide.</p><h2>Wringer: A Newbery Honor Award Winner (Trophy Newbery)</h2><p><p><strong>Newbery Honor Book * ALA Notable Children's Book </strong></p><p><strong>"Deeply felt.

Nine-year-old Palmer dreads his upcoming 10th birthday. In his town, when boys are 10 years old they become "wringers," the boys who wring the necks of wounded pigeons at the annual Pigeon Day shoot. Palmer is sickened by the whole event. To make matters worse, his new buddies--Beans, Mutto, and Henry--have just discovered that Palmer has been hiding a pet pigeon in his room. What will Palmer do? Will he become a wringer to save face, or will he follow his heart? <i>Wringer</i> will appeal to preteens and younger teens who love to read suspenseful books on their own, but it would also be a good story to read aloud to spark discussion about the perils and nuances of peer pressure.<p>Palmer LaRue is running out of birthdays. For as long as he can remember, he's dreaded the day he turns ten -- the day he'll take his place beside all the other ten-year-old boys in town, the day he'll be a wringer. But Palmer doesn't want to be a wringer. It's one of the first things he learned about himself and it's one of the biggest things he has to hide. In Palmer's town being a wringer is an honor, a tradition passed down from father to son. Palmer can't stop himself from being a wringer just like he can't stop himself from growing one year older, just like he can't stand up to a whole town -- right? Newbery Medal winner Jerry Spinelli's most powerful novel yet is a gripping tale of how one boy learns how not to be afraid. </p></p><h2>Modern Crochet: Patterns and Designs for the Minimalist Maker</h2><p><p><strong>A comprehensive guide for beginning and experienced crocheters alike, <em>Modern Crochet </em>elevates the craft for a new generation of makers.

This new hardcover volume reprints the original 1924 edition, which launched the million-copy series. Ranked among the all-time "Top 100 Chapter Books," or children's novels, in a <i>School Library Journal</i> survey, the book is also among the National Education Association's "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children."</p><p>American author Gertrude Chandler Warner (1890&#x2013;1979) wrote several stories for children, and her 1924 book, <i>The Box-Car Children, </i>was so successful that she published 18 sequels. The series' popularity has continued to grow: there are currently 150 other books, written by many authors, as well as two animated films. Warner was also a school teacher who read the original story to her classes and rewrote it many times to make sure that it would be both engaging and easy to read. She noted that the book "raised a storm of protest from librarians who thought the children were having too good a time without any parental control!

From Colorado to New Mexico, Las Vegas to L.A., Alex records a journey on his iPod to show other lifeforms what life on earth, <i>his</i> earth, is like. But his destination keeps changing.

My name is Alex Petroski and my house is in Rockview, Colorado, United States of America, planet Earth. I am eleven years and eight months old&nbsp;and the United States is two hundred forty-two years old and Earth is 4.5 billion years old. I&#x2019;m not sure how old my house is.</p><p>Maybe you live on an ice planet, so instead of houses you have igloos and your hands are icepicks and your feet are snowshoes and you&#x2019;re covered in gold-brown fur like Carl Sagan. That&#x2019;s my dog. I named him after my hero, Dr. Carl Sagan, who was one of the greatest astronomers of our time. Dr. Sagan helped send Voyagers 1 and 2 into deep space and put a Golden Record on them with all kinds of sounds from our planet, like whales singing and people saying hello in fifty-five languages, and the laugh of a newborn baby and the brainwaves of a woman in love and mankind&#x2019;s greatest music like Bach and Beethoven and Chuck Berry. Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard it?</p><p>I found my pup Carl Sagan in the parking lot at Safeway, and when I saw him he was dirty and hungry and hiding behind a dumpster. I said, Come here boy, don&#x2019;t be scared, but he was crying and curling his tail because we were still strangers at that point. I told him I&#x2019;m not going to hurt him, I&#x2019;m a pacifist, and I guess he believed me because when I picked him up he didn&#x2019;t even fight me or try to run. Then I took him back to my house and my mom was lying on the sofa watching her shows like she usually does, and I told her I got the groceries but I got a pup also and I&#x2019;ll take good care of him I promise, I&#x2019;ll play with him and feed him and give him a bath and all the stuff you&#x2019;re supposed to say.</p><p>And she said, You&#x2019;re in the way! So I got out of the way. My best friend Benji&#x2019;s mom would freak if he brought home a pup, but my mom, she doesn&#x2019;t care as long as I make us dinner and don&#x2019;t bother her when she&#x2019;s watching her shows. She&#x2019;s a pretty cool mom.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what kind of shows you guys have but the ones my mom likes are game shows and judge shows and shows with five ladies sitting in a fake living room. When I&#x2019;m at Benji&#x2019;s house we watch Cartoon Network because his family has On Demand, and Benji loves <i>Battlemorph Academy</i> and so do a lot of the kids at school. I think that show&#x2019;s OK but I prefer the more classic cartoons like<i>Dexter&#x2019;s Laboratory</i> to be honest. That Dexter is one smart kid. I hate it when his sister Didi goes in and messes up everything. I&#x2019;m glad I don&#x2019;t have a sister to mess up my stuff, especially when I&#x2019;m working on my rocket.</p><p>I do have an older brother though. His name is Ronnie but everyone calls him RJ except my mom and me and some of his old high school friends because his middle name is James. Ronnie&#x2019;s a lot older, he&#x2019;s more than twice how old I am. He&#x2019;s twenty-four. He lives in Los Angeles and his job is an agent, and I know what you&#x2019;re thinking but he&#x2019;s not that kind of agent. He&#x2019;s not a spy or Bond, James Bond kind of agent. He doesn&#x2019;t fight terrorists or bust drug dealers or play poker with super-villains. He helps basketball and football players get shoe commercials. But he does go to fancy parties and wear sunglasses, so I guess it&#x2019;s kind of the same.</p><p>Ronnie wouldn&#x2019;t let me keep Carl Sagan at first. He never likes it when my mom and me spend his money on stuff that isn&#x2019;t groceries or bills for our house. When I told him about Carl Sagan over the phone he said, Uh-uh, we can&#x2019;t afford a dog. I said I think we CAN afford a dog because I&#x2019;ve been getting the on-sale food from Safeway and making my own sandwiches for school instead of buying hot lunch, and also I got a part-time job helping Mr. Bashir stack magazines at his gas station. I said, I&#x2019;ve been saving the money for my rocket but I can use some of it to buy Carl Sagan&#x2019;s food because he&#x2019;s not that big of a dog, and besides, you should come back to Rockview sometime and meet him in person&#x2014;I mean, in dog&#x2014;before you make any brash decisions.</p><p>That was almost a year ago and Ronnie still hasn&#x2019;t met Carl Sagan in dog yet. But I&#x2019;m sure when they finally do meet that Ronnie&#x2019;s going to love him because who can turn down that face?</p><p>Huh? Who can turn down that face?</p><p>That&#x2019;s right, I&#x2019;m talking about you, Carl Sagan. Do you want to say hello?</p><p>Come on boy, say hello.</p><p>Carl Sagan doesn&#x2019;t want to say hello. He&#x2019;s just staring at me like, What are you doing? Who are you talking to? Is there a person in there? I don&#x2019;t see a person in there.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no person in here boy, it&#x2019;s just an iPod. You watched me spray-paint it gold, remember? I&#x2019;m making recordings so when intelligent beings millions of light-years away find it one day they&#x2019;ll know what Earth was like, do you understand?</p><p>He doesn&#x2019;t understand. Now he&#x2019;s looking out the window. He&#x2019;s easily distracted.</p><p>So then I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What was I talking about?</p><p>Anyway, I thought that maybe you guys already got my hero&#x2019;s Golden Record but maybe you don&#x2019;t have record players where you are, or you used to but not anymore. The only ones I&#x2019;ve ever seen are the used ones at Goodwill and nobody buys them because iPods and iPhones fit in your pocket better. Also, this iPod can hold a lot more than a record. I already uploaded everything from the Golden Record onto here and there was so much room left, and then I found out you can make recordings too, so I thought maybe I could record some sounds from Earth that you haven&#x2019;t already heard. Plus I&#x2019;ll explain everything that&#x2019;s happening behind the scenes while I get ready for my launch. It&#x2019;ll be like Blu-ray bonus features!</p><p>There&#x2019;s SO much I want to tell you guys. But it&#x2019;ll have to wait because Carl Sagan&#x2019;s sitting by the door because he wants to go pee and poop. And I still have to pack everything for my trip! I&#x2019;ll tell you about SHARF and my rocket next time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>New Recording 2</b></p><p><i>6m 41s</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hi again, guys!

I&#x2019;m launching my rocket there in three days!</p><p>The official name is the Southwest High-Altitude Rocket Festival but everyone on Rocketforum.org just calls it SHARF. It&#x2019;s an acronym. Acronyms are words made using the first letter of other words, like how NASA is National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In fourth grade we made acronyms from our own names and I used my full first name even though Mrs. Thompson said I could just use Alex. I wanted to challenge myself.

Frances19 said she&#x2019;s dyeing her hair a special color for SHARF and Ganymede and Europa were talking about how much fun last year&#x2019;s was, and Calexico posted a bunch of cool tips about camping, like if you leave your shoes outside your tent at night make sure you turn them upside down in the morning because there might be scorpions. He said they show up in pairs too, so if you find one scorpion you&#x2019;ll usually find another. They&#x2019;re very romantic creatures.</p><p>I already packed my rocket and toothbrush and Ronnie&#x2019;s old tent, and a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner because it&#x2019;ll save me some room. I packed Carl Sagan&#x2019;s special kibble also&#x2014;they&#x2019;re going to have barbecue food at SHARF but Carl Sagan can&#x2019;t eat it because he has a sensitive digestive system.</p><p>I still have more to pack but I needed a break, so I came up to the roof of my house. I love lying down on the hood of a car like Dr. Arroway in the movie<i>Contact </i>but my mom doesn&#x2019;t drive anymore, so I just come up on our ladder to the roof. I usually come up here at night so that way I&#x2019;m closer to the stars, even though it&#x2019;s only one story closer.</p><p>I like coming up here during the day too though. Our subdivision is on a hill, and when I&#x2019;m up here I can see really far. I can see the train tracks and Burger King and I can see Mr. Bashir&#x2019;s gas station which has a flagpole outside with the biggest American flag in Rockview, it&#x2019;s SO huge. Way in the distance I can see Mount Sam and the big white letter<i>R</i> for Rockview on the side near the bottom. One time before Ronnie&#x2019;s homecoming game against our town&#x2019;s rivals, Belmar, some kids from Belmar High came in the middle of the night and changed the<i>R</i> to a <i>B, </i>and the next day Ronnie was so mad that he ran for five touchdowns and our team kicked their team&#x2019;s butts. I guess their plan backfired.</p><p>Sometimes after my mom has one of her quiet days she&#x2019;ll need fresh air so she&#x2019;ll go for a walk, and when I&#x2019;m up here I can see where she walks. Like right now she&#x2019;s walking toward Justin Mendoza&#x2019;s house, which is down our street toward the bottom of the hill, and when she gets to Justin&#x2019;s house she&#x2019;ll either turn left toward Mill Road or turn right toward Benji&#x2019;s subdivision. I can&#x2019;t see that as good because it&#x2019;s surrounded by trees.</p><p>Justin&#x2019;s the one who gave me this iPod, actually! He was a grade lower than Ronnie in high school and he used to come over and play with Ronnie all the time, but he didn&#x2019;t move away after college like Ronnie did. I went over there yesterday to buy the iPod from him for twenty dollars like we agreed, but then he said I could just have it for free because the battery sucks. He went inside his house to get it and I waited in his garage, and I was looking at the Honda motorcycle he&#x2019;s always working on and I squeezed one of the handles, but when I did a screw fell out, so I put it on a blue rag with a bunch of other parts.</p><p>Justin came back with the iPod and charger and I said, Hey Justin, your job is a mechanic, shouldn&#x2019;t you be done working on your motorcycle already? He said his problem is he&#x2019;ll think he&#x2019;s done but then he&#x2019;ll ride around on it for a while and think of something better to do, so he&#x2019;ll take it apart and start over again. I told him he should just download a simulator for his motorcycle like the one I found for my rocket called OpenRocket. It lets me put in different motors and change the nose cone and fins and everything, and it tells me exactly how high the rocket&#x2019;s going to go so that way I don&#x2019;t even have to buy any parts until I&#x2019;m ready to launch. I told him that&#x2019;s how I designed Voyager 3, my rocket that&#x2019;s going to carry his iPod into space.</p><p>Justin said, So it&#x2019;s going to be your first launch ever? And I said that&#x2019;s right, and he said, Shouldn&#x2019;t you do some test launches? And I said, That&#x2019;s the whole point of the simulator, it&#x2019;s so I don&#x2019;t have to, DUH!</p><p>Justin laughed and he asked me how&#x2019;s Ronnie doing, and I told him Ronnie&#x2019;s busy like usual with his prospective clients. A prospective client is someone who Ronnie wants to want Ronnie to be their agent, so he takes them out to lunch and he pays for their lunch. Justin said he really looks up to Ronnie, he&#x2019;s always thought of him like an older brother, and I said that&#x2019;s funny because I&#x2019;ve always thought of him like an older brother too, and Justin laughed again. He told me to let him know how my launch goes and I said I will, and I told him he might want to check the handle on his motorcycle to make sure there aren&#x2019;t any parts missing.</p></p><h2>Black Butler, Vol. 1 (Black Butler, 1)</h2><p>Just a stone&#39;s throw from London lies the manor house of the illustrious Phantomhive earldom, its master one Ciel Phantomhive.

From the day it opened on July 17, 1955, Disneyland brought history and fairy tales to life, the future into the present, and exciting cultures and galaxies unknown to our imaginations.</p><p>This bountiful visual history draws on Disney&#x2019;s vast historical collections, private archives, and the golden age of photojournalism to provide unique access to the concept, development, launch, and enjoyment of this sun-drenched oasis of fun and fantasy.

As many people responded to the call of God to <em>wait</em> on Him,&nbsp;several things have become very apparent:</p> <ul> <li>Many are encountering the simple yet overwhelming joy and peace of our Father to a hugely greater extent than ever and report walking in a personal love relationship with God.</li> <li>Others are&nbsp;hearing and acting on an ever clearer whisper of His voice in their hearts. He is even giving some answers to prayers they&nbsp;have never even prayed.</li> </ul> <p>These words are from Andrew Murray: <em>"I send forth these meditations; I can only cast them on the love of my brethren, and of our God.

He lives with his wife, Ruth Brown, also a well-known children&#x2019;s illustrator, in England.In this gentle picture book with an old-fashioned feel, an enterprising chicken pulls off a hat trick of sorts when she finds a way to obtain a chapeau she admires. Chicken would love to have Scarecrow's straw hat for her very own. Scarecrow says he would gladly swap his headdress for a walking stick, something that Chicken does not possess. So Chicken sets out to visit Badger, who does have a walking stick. Trouble is Badger wants to make a trade, too, for something else Chicken can't provide--a ribbon. Chicken calls on an array of animal pals until she at last makes the deal that leads her back to Scarecrow's hat, via a chain reaction of satisfying swaps. British author/illustrator Brown's (Dilly-Dally and the Nine Secrets) story proceeds at a leisurely pace, allowing young readers time to join in Chicken's creative problem-solving. A couple of missteps in logic (a sheep is happy to have a pair of broken glasses; Scarecrow is the only inanimate object to speak) don't mar the easygoing mood. The true standout here, however, is Brown's artwork--his airy, sun-dappled watercolors evoke a pleasant summer day.

Ansary gives a riveting account of how George Washington sought to put in place in America an economic system that was the antithesis of what had existed in the colonies under British rule. The entrepreneurial economy &#x2013; which nurtures and rewards innovation and inventiveness &#x2013; did not sprout into being in the United States by sheer happenstance. It was put in place by our first President. He painstakingly laid the foundation for it, but it did not take root without a struggle. He needed extraordinary tenacity to overcome fierce opposition to his program.President Washington&#x2019;s economic initiatives are the least well understood facets of Washington&#x2019;s busy and productive life. They enlarged the dreams and opportunities of Americans, led to a flourishing entrepreneurial climate, and are an inspiring tale for our time.</p><p></p><h2>The Promises of God Storybook Bible: The Story of God&#39;s Unstoppable Love</h2><p><p><b>God&#x2019;s love is unstoppable.&nbsp;And that&#x2019;s a promise.</b></p><p>Noah&#x2019;s ark.

When Communist revolutionaries occupy her town, an escalating witch hunt against capitalists compels her parents to send her and her brother to the U.S. under the care of the Catholic Welfare Bureau (as part of "Operation Pedro Pan," which&#x2014;the endnotes explain&#x2014;was the largest-ever exodus of unaccompanied children in the West). Lucía eventually settles with a foster family in Nebraska, where she comes to terms with her duel identity as a Cuban exile and an American teen. She must also piece together a picture of what's happening to her parents and friends at home from interrupted phone calls, censored letters, and newspaper articles. This well-written novel has a thoroughly believable protagonist and well-chosen period details. It should be noted, however, that Gonzalez portrays the single sympathetic Communist character as increasingly brainwashed. Few readers will recognize the polemics driving this convincing story, but as an introduction to the history and politics of the Cuban-exile community, it could generate some excellent classroom discussions.&#x2014;<i>Rhona Campbell, Washington, DC Public Library</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.
